The NetHack DevTeam is announcing the release of NetHack 3.6.7 on
February 16, 2023

NetHack 3.6.7 is the official release of NetHack that follows NetHack 3.6.6.

This release primarily corrects a security issue present in NetHack 
versions 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.6.5, and 3.6.6. 
For details about the security issues please see https://www.nethack.org/security.
You are encouraged to update to NetHack 3.6.7 as soon as possible.

Here's a brief synopsis of the handful of bug fixes included in NetHack 3.6.7:

 -  invalid status highlight color could be maliciously used to corrupt memory
 -  formatting corpse names used internal buffers differently from formatting
        other objects and could potentially clobber memory
 -  during engraving, spaces were counted instead of non-space (cherry-pick of
        4e0a1e04 from NetHack-3.7)
 -  avoid potential buffer overflow in append_str()
 -  resolve missing dependency in NetHack.sln
 -  code in include/tradstdc.h was trying to suppress warn_unused result by
        defining warn_unused_result to an empty string and that began causing
        a build error within a system-supplied header file cdefs.h when using
        Ubuntu Impish 21.10; disable that for any Linux and macOS gcc unless
        GCC_URWARN is defined to force it back into effect
 -  update_inventory() after leash goes slack
 -  player assigned name for monsters, specific objects, or object types could be
        longer than what was intented to be allowed; for 'curses', much longer
 -  Windows: added winflexbison to travis-ci configuration to permit full build of
             levcomp and dgncomp
 -  Windows: a bad chdir specified in win/win32/dgnstuff.mak caused full build to
             abort
 -  Windows: the console.rc file had outdated information stating 3.6.3 when the
             official 3.6.6 binary had been built.
 -  Windows: switch from using keyhandling dll's to incorporating the three 
             variations (default, ray, 340) in sys/winnt/nttty.c
 -  curses: cherry-picked selectsaved code from 3.7 for menu of save files
 -  NetHackW: fix delayed rendering of cursor when using farlook

All of the fixes have been published on the public Git repository for the game.
A more complete list can be found in the game's sources in doc/fixes36.7. As usual,
a warning that some entries in that file may also be "spoilers".

Existing saved games and bones files from 3.6.0 through to 3.6.6 should work with
3.6.7, assuming that the same build configuration options were used with
the same compiler.

Checksums (sha256) of binaries that you have downloaded from nethack.org
can be verified on Windows platforms using:
    certUtil -hashfile nethack-367-win-x86.zip SHA256

The following command can be used on most platforms to help confirm the location of
various files that NetHack may use:
    nethack --showpaths

As with all releases of the game, we appreciate your feedback. Please submit any
bugs using the problem report form. Also, please check the "known bugs" list
before you log a problem - somebody else may have already found it.

Happy NetHacking!
