Liquid War (v5.6.4) - Work in progress




Note on releases
================


  Whenever Liquid War is released, I usually pass the good news to Freshmeat (
  http://freshmeat.net/projects/liquidwar/ ). Then all releases are accessible
  from the main download page, which is
  http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5/download.

  Releasing the game takes time, for I want all binaries to install properly
  and sources to compile cleanly. Therefore there might be some delay before
  the time coding is over and the time a release is actually ready. So for
  impatients and/or for people who need to test out the very latest versions
  (eg someone who wants to compile the game on a new platform), it's possible
  to access the source repository directly.



About GNU Arch
==============


  I use GNU Arch (Tom Lord's Arch in fact,
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ ) instead of the previously used CVS.
  Indeed, tla has some very fancy features such as signing patches with gpg,
  and I'm tired of suffering CVS limitations.

  So FYI the previously active CVS repositories, on Sourceforge and Savannah,
  are currently unmaintained.



How to get latest releases
==========================


  * Step 1: read the excellent Arch tutorial
    http://regexps.srparish.net/www/tutorial/html/arch.html if you are not
    familiar with tla. I admit there's a steep learning curve, but it's yet
    clear and understandable.

  * Step 2: point on the repository, which is accessible (read-only) on
    http://arch.sv.gnu.org/archives/liquidwar/.

  A typical set of tla commands would be:

  tla register-archive http://arch.sv.gnu.org/archives/liquidwar
  tla get -A liquidwar@sv.gnu.org liquidwar6--stable

  If you are interested, I can open this repository in read/write mode, however
  one of the points of GNU Arch is that it allows cooperative developpement
  with multiple depots, so this isn't mandatory. And anyways, importing myself
  patches received by email has never been a real burden.

  Besides, most developpement is now done on Liquid War 6. See
  http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/ or http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v6
  for more informations.
