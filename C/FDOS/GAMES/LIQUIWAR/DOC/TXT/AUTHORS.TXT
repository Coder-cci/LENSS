Liquid War (v5.6.4) - Authors




Thom-Thom
=========


  Liquid War rules have been invented by Thomas Colcombet.

  He was trying to find algorithms to find the shortest path from one point to
  another, and found the Liquid War algorithm. Then it came to his mind that a
  game could be build upon this algorithm, and Liquid War was born. He
  programmed the first two versions of Liquid War using Borland Pascal for DOS,
  and gave me some information about the algorithm so that I could re-program
  it.

  I'm the guy who programmed the latest versions of Liquid War. I enhanced the
  algorithms, and did quite a bunch of work to have the game playable by
  (almost) anyone, that's to say create a correct GUI.

Other contributors
==================


  As Liquid War is now free software, protected by the GPL, anyone is allowed
  to view, edit, modify, re-compile the source code, and distribute it, as long
  as Liquid War is still distributed under the GPL.

  Here's a list of the contributors:

  * Alstar: drew a map, which is now included in the main distribution.

  * Peter Wang: ported Liquid War to GNU/Linux.

  * Cort Danger Stratton : helped me setting up network support.

  * Tim Chadburn : wrote midi files for the game. His contribution has been
    truely appreciated since it's rather hard to find GNU GPL compliant
    artwork. He also wrote documentation and helped with midi support in
    general.

  * Jan Gretschuskin : contributed 11 maps, and made the German translation. So
    if you run Liquid War with German menus, you know who you have to thank ->
    Jan! 8-) Also do not forget to visit http://www.game-factor.de

  * Mouse : contributed a map.

  * Rene Stach : drew 3 maps.

  * Roderick Schertler : implemented HTTP 1.1 support.

  * Ryan D. Brown : ported Liquid War to Mac OS X.

    support.

  * Michael Terry : provided a .desktop file for better integration with Gnome,
    KDE and other UNIX desktop environments.

  * Kasper Hviid : contributed many maps, with their own textures, and made the
    Danish translation. Great work, also available on

  * David Redick : wrote an external random map generator, available on
    http://xdavidx.sqrville.org/lwmapgen/index.html

  Many other people helped me by submitting bug reports and patches, and I want
  to thank them for their precious help. Thanks to all the Debian people too,
  who nicely maintain the Liquid War .deb package.
