                       Copyright (C) 2017 Mateusz Viste


DWOL is a tiny tool that computes and sends "wake-on-lan" packets. Wake-On-LAN
(WOL) is an Ethernet standard that allows a computer to be turned on by a
network message. The WOL technology has been designed by AMD back in 1995, and
widely implemented inside many Ethernet chips and mainboards since then.
DWOL is designed with two goals: being tiny (no bigger than a single floppy
disk sector, that is 512 bytes), yet still performing proper input validation
and providing the user with clear, friendly messages.

Project's homepage: http://dwol.sourceforge.net

Usage syntax: DWOL etheraddr

Example: DWOL 54:52:00:a0:67:7c

The MAC address is case-insensitive.

DWOL exits with code 0 on success. If an error occurs, it exits with an exit
code of 1.

DWOL requires an Ethernet packet driver. The packet driver is auto-detected by
scanning the interrupt range 60h...80h. DWOL uses the first packet driver that
it finds.


===[ It's no magic ]==========================================================

DWOL is only a packet-sending tool. It won't magically turn on any remote
computer if said computer is not configured to allow this. DWOL, like any
other WOL implementation, requires Wake-On-LAN hardware support on the
destination computer. WOL must also be explicitely enabled, either through
the computer's BIOS settings or/and through its operating system.


===[ Requirements ]===========================================================

DWOL doesn't require much to work, but here we go:
 * an IBM PC or compatible (8086/8088 CPU or better),
 * MS-DOS 2.0+ or compatible,
 * an Ethernet adapter with a packet driver complying to pkt drv spec v1.10+.
