NAME
    E100PKT 0.3, packet driver for DOS

SYNOPSIS
    E100PKT <option>

DESCRIPTION
    E100PKT is a basic packet driver for Intel's 8255x family of
    Ethernet adapters. It should work with any PCI device that
    Linux's e100 kernel module (in e100.c) does.

    Options are case-insensitive and must begin with either a / or -.
    All the program's input and output is in hex without a leading
    "0x" (e.g. "60" is 96 decimal).

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    * An IBM PC or compatible
    * An Intel 80386 or compatible processor
    * DOS 2 or higher
    * 2560 bytes of free conventional memory
    * An Intel E100 Ethernet adapter. That is, a PCI device whose
      vendor id is 8086 and device id is one of the following:

OPTIONS
    /h
    /?
        Show usage.
    /v
        Show version.
    /u
        Unload the packet driver from memory.
    /i <int_no>
        Load the packet driver into memory at the specified software
        interrupt. Valid interrupt numbers are: 60-66, 68-6f, or
        7b-7e (inclusive).
    /d
        Dump PCI configuration space to E100.PCI
        Dump EEPROM to E100.EEP
        Dump CSR to E100.CSR

BUGS
    * E100PKT cannot be loaded high.
    * E100PKT uses too much memory.
    * E100PKT cannot be unloaded if its hardware interrupt vector
      has been hooked since loading it.
    * Please send any feedback and bug reports to <sethsimon@sdf.org>.
