E100PKT CHANGELOG

0.3 (2022-10-16)
    * Make make.bat's "package" argument work in subdirectories.
    * Allow tabs in the command tail.
    * Allow older devices whose CSR size isn't 0x40 to be installed and
      modify the dump function to use the actual size. Thanks to
      Dr. Nick Downing for finding this bug.

0.2
    * Add a "package" argument to make.bat.
    * Add support for IRQ sharing.
    * Check SP to make sure the BSS/stack don't overwrite each other.
    * Compress information so it fits in 80x25 text mode.
    * During unloading, close the handle if the call to f_terminate()
      fails.
    * Fix undefined behavior during unloading when:
        1) The IRQ >= 8, and
        2) The software interrupt vector is >= 7b
    * In int_in_use() and handle_fr(), use OR instead of ADD when
      checking for NULL pointers.
    * Make print_nibble() smaller.
    * More thoroughly verify the CSR IO BAR, and fix an off-by-one
      error in the old verification code.
    * Rather than dumping nothing at all when an error occurs, dump
      what we can. For example, if the CSR IO BAR is invalid, we can
      still dump PCI configuration space.
    * Reduce the resident memory footprint from 4160 to 2560 bytes.
    * s/1518/1514 since software never sees the FCS.
    * Thank Intel for the programming manual.
    * Verify that the number of bits in the EEPROM address field is
      6 or 8.

0.1
    * Initial release
