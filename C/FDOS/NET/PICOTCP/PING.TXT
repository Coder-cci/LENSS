This is the "documentation" of the ping command shipped with the picotcp4dos
stack. ping loads the networking configuration pointed by the %PICOTCP%
environment variable.

Syntax:  ping host

where "host" can be either an IP address, or a host name (in the latter case,
a DNS name resolution will be attempted).
