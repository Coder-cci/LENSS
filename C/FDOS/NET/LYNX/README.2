This is a port of Lynx 2.9.0dev.10 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

  Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
  cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100 terminals,
  vt100 emulators running on character-cell display.  It will display Hypertext
  Markup Language (HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system,
  as well as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
  finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to telnet,
  tn3270 or rlogin accounts.



1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        This port has been configured using DJGPP 2.06 (CVS repository code).
        It has been configured to be build in the "0build" directory under the
        top srcdir.

        The port has been configured and compiled on WinXP SP3 and Win98SE.
        There is no guarantee that this may be possible with any other DOS-
        like OS.  Due to the use of long file names it will not be possible
        to configure and compile without LFN support.

        The port has been configured and compiled with support enabled for
        BZIP2, ZLIB, PDCURSE, IDN, OPENSSL and WATT-32.  The used ports are:
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2apps/bz2-108a.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/lidn138b.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/zlb1211b.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/pdcur39a.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/ssl102ub.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2tk/wat3211b.zip
        Later versions may also work.  Previous versions have never been tested.
        Programs compiled with openssl require the installation of a noise
        source like:
          http://www.rahul.net/dkaufman/noise063a2.zip
        Programs compiled with WATT-32 requires a valid wattcp.cfg configuration
        file.  This must reflect the used network environment and hardware.
        The WATTCP.CFG environment variable must be set to point to this file.

        The port has been configured and build without NLS support enabled.
        To enable this feature, the latest ports of libiconv and gettext must
        be installed:
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/licv116b.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/gtxt201b.zip
        If you prefer NLS, then reconfigure the sources passing the nls flag
        to the config.bat file.

        The port has been configured with IDN support.  Having IDN support
        requires installing the iconv port.  The following ports have been
        used:
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/lidn138b.zip
          http://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/licv116b.zip
        No other versions have been tested.  Linking with the idn library
        always requires also linking with iconv library because it provides
        the requires character set recoding capability.

        The program will look in the canonical directory, this is /dev/env/DJDIR/etc
        for its control files like lynx.cfg and lynx.lss.  This behavior can
        be changed by setting the LYNX_CFG and LYNX_LSS environment variables
        to point to different files.  If the files cannot be found there, then
        the program will try to load them from the installation directory of
        lynx.

        The program will support long file names inclusive names starting with
        a dot if a LFN support driver is installed.

        To be able to run the program, a DOS packet driver (PKTDRVR) is required.
        This may be obtained from the card manufacturer or from one of the archives
        of packet drivers (such as "http://www.lanet.lv/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html"
        or "http://ftp.freenet.de/pub/ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/pktdrvr/").
        Even when only browsing local files, a NULLPKT packet driver is required
        like nullpkt.zip.  The zip file can be downloaded as:
          http://www.jumpjet.info/Application-Software/DOS/Hardware/2/NULLPKT/NULLPKT.zip

        The lynx executable itself handles http:, https:, ftp:, file:, news:,
        nntp: and gopher: protocols. You will need external programs if you
        want to access telnet:, tn3270:, or mailto: URLs.  In this case a port
        of kermit may be required.

        When connecting to a site via https, lynx will require that a file of
        trusted certificates is available.  It is yours responsability to create
        such a file and the port will never provide one.  This file in .PEM 
        format is created using openssl tools.  Read the openssl documentation.
        A working linux installation provides always one.  It may be found by
        the name ca-bundle.pem or similar.  In the end it must be a file in PEM
        format.  Store it where you like and point to it by setting the corresponding
        lynx environment variable like this:
          set SSL_CERT_FILE=/dev/env/DJDIR/share/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.pem
        Of course the value propossed is arbitrary and reflects the way I do
        it for my own installation of lynx.  A starting point for reading about
        how to create your own PEM files is:
          https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lynx-dev/2002-12/msg00043.html
        It describes how to create one using the trusted certificates provide
        by the microsoft IE.
        It is also possible to obtain up to date cert bundles from this site:
          https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html
        In this port, the last version available from thw above site has been
        include.

        The port does not support javascript at all thus it cannot be used where
        this feature is required.

        It is important to realize that this port will only work under plain
        DOS.  It will not work in a DOS session of any Windows.  If for some
        reason you think that lynx must be used under Windows, you should
        download a windows port of lynx.

        Only to make this point clear, if you want to use lynx as a stand alone
        program without having to care about environment variables, copy lynx.exe,
        lynx.cfg and lynx.lss into the same directory and it will work.
        When copying the .PEM file it must be renamed to "cert.pem".  This is
        mandatory or it will not be found.

        As usual, all djgpp specific files (config.bat, diffs, README files,
        etc.) are stored in the /djgpp directory.

        For further information about Lynx please read the info docs and NEWS file.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 l290d10br2.zip      or
          djtarx l290d10br2.zip       or
          pkunzip -d l290d10br2.zip


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 l290d10sr2.zip      or
          djtarx l290d10sr2.zip       or
          pkunzip -d l290d10sr2.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev205.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh205bbr3.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, gppNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip,
          shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip,
          pdcurNNNa.zip, mktmpNNb.zip and gwkNNNb.zip.

        If you want to configure and compile this packages with NLS support
        enabled you must install licvNNNb.zip and gtxNNNNb.zip.

        You will also need the Watt-32 and the OpenSSL libraries wat3211b.zip
        and ssl102ub.zip.  No previous versions.

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages.  All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh205bbr3.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev205.zip.

3.3.:   The package has been configured to be build in a separate build directory
        under the top srcdir (aka lynx-2.9.0).  To build the binaries cd
        into "0build" directory.  If for some reason you want to reconfigure the
        package cd into the build directory and run the following commands:
          del config.cache
          make clean
          ..\djgpp\config ./..

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the 0build
        directory or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        Please also note that the WATT_ROOT environment variable __MUST__
        point to the installed WATT-32 port or the WATT-32 headers and libraries
        will not be found.

        config.bat, among other things, will start the configure script passing
        to it a couple of arguments.  You can control these argument passing the
        following command line arguments to config.bat:
          nls or no-nls, default nls.  NLS support enabled.
          cache or no-cache, default cache.  Cache in build directory.
          dep or no-dep, default no-dep.  No dependency tracking.
          silent or no-silent, default silent.  Controls the verbosity of the
                                                build process.
          zlib or no-zlib, default zlib.  Link lynx with zlib to enable
                                          zlib compression support.
          bzlib or no-bzlib, default bzlib.  Link lynx with bzip2 library to
                                             enable bzip2 compression support.
          ssl or no-ssl, default ssl.  Link lynx with OpenSSL to enable SSL v2/v3
                                       and TLS v1 support.
          trace or no-trace, default trace.  Enable logic for trace code.
          vtrace or no-vtrace, default vtrace.  Enable verbose trace code.
        All other configure specific options are not set by config.bat so their
        values are left as they are.  If no arguments are passed to config.bat
        then the default values are used.


        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\contrib\lynx-2.9.0\djgpp\config x:/src/contrib/lynx-2.9.0

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\contrib\lynx-2.9.0\djgpp\config x:/src/contrib/lynx-2.9.0

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.6.:   To install the binaries and info docs run the following command from
        the directory where you have configured the sources:
          make install-full

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropriate
        value:
          make install-full prefix=z:/some/other/place
