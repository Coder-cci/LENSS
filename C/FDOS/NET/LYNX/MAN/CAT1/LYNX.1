DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _L_y_n_x is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users  running
       cursor-addressable,   character-cell   display   devices  (e.g.,  vt100
       terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8 or any POSIX
       platform,  or  any  other  "curses-oriented" display).  It will display
       hypertext markup language (HTML) documents containing  links  to  files
       residing  on  the  local  system,  as  well as files residing on remote
       systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP  servers.   Current
       versions  of _L_y_n_x run on Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8, DOS DJGPP and
       OS/2.

       _L_y_n_x can be used to access information on the World  Wide  Web,  or  to
       build  information  systems  intended  primarily for local access.  For
       example, _L_y_n_x has been used to build several  Campus  Wide  Information
       Systems  (CWIS).   In  addition,  _L_y_n_x  can  be  used  to build systems
       isolated within a single LAN.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       At start up, _L_y_n_x will load any local file or remote URL  specified  at
       the  command line.  For help with URLs, press "??"  or "HH" while running
       _L_y_n_x.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."

       If more than one local file or remote URL  is  listed  on  the  command
       line,  _L_y_n_x  will  open  only the last interactively.  All of the names
       (local files and remote URLs) are added to the GG))oottoo history.

       _L_y_n_x uses only long option names.  Option names can begin  with  double
       dash  "--"  as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option
       names (in the reference below, options are  shown  with  one  dash  "-"
       before them, and with underscores "_").

       _L_y_n_x  provides many command-line options.  Some options require a value
       (string, number or keyword).  These are noted in the  reference  below.
       The  other  options set boolean values in the program.  There are three
       types of boolean options: set, unset and toggle.  If no option value is
       given, these have the obvious meaning: set (to true), unset (to false),
       or toggle (between true/false).  For any of these,  an  explicit  value
       can  be  given  in  different  forms  to  allow  for  operating  system
       constraints, e.g.,

           --cceenntteerr::ooffff
           --cceenntteerr==ooffff
           --cceenntteerr--

       _L_y_n_x recognizes "1", "+", "on" and "true" for  true  values,  and  "0",
       "-",  "off"  and  "false"  for  false  values.  Other option-values are
       ignored.

       The default boolean, number and string option values that are  compiled
       into  _L_y_n_x  are  displayed  in the help-message provided by llyynnxx --hheellpp.
       Some of those may differ according to how _L_y_n_x was built; see the  help
       message  itself for these values.  The --hheellpp option is processed in the
       third pass of options-processing, so any option which sets a value,  as
       well as runtime configuration values are reflected in the help-message.

       --      If  the  argument  is only "-", then _L_y_n_x expects to receive the
              arguments from the standard input.  This is  to  allow  for  the
              potentially  very  long command line that can be associated with
              the --ggeett__ddaattaa or --ppoosstt__ddaattaa arguments (see below).  It can  also
              be  used  to  avoid having sensitive information in the invoking
              command line (which would be visible to other processes on  most
              systems), especially when the --aauutthh or --ppaauutthh options are used.

       --aacccceepptt__aallll__ccooookkiieess
              accept all cookies.

       --aannoonnyymmoouuss
              apply    restrictions    for   anonymous   account,   see   also
              --rreessttrriiccttiioonnss.

       --aassssuummee__cchhaarrsseett=_M_I_M_E_n_a_m_e
              charset for documents that do not specify it.

       --aassssuummee__llooccaall__cchhaarrsseett=_M_I_M_E_n_a_m_e
              charset assumed for local files, i.e., files which _L_y_n_x  creates
              such as internal pages for the options menu.

       --aassssuummee__uunnrreecc__cchhaarrsseett=_M_I_M_E_n_a_m_e
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

       --aauutthh=_I_D:_P_A_S_S_W_D
              set  authorization  ID  and  password for protected documents at
              startup.  Be sure to protect any script  files  which  use  this
              switch.

       --bbaassee  prepend  a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html outputs
              for --ssoouurrccee dumps.

       --bbiibbhhoosstt=_U_R_L
              specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).

       --bblliinnkk forces high intensity  background  colors  for  color  mode,  if
              available  and  supported  by the terminal.  This applies to the
              ssllaanngg library (for a few terminal emulators),  or  to  OS/2  EMX
              with nnccuurrsseess.

       --bbooookk  use  the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
              line startfile is still set for the  Main  screen  command,  and
              will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

       --bbuurriieedd__nneewwss
              toggles  scanning  of  news  articles for buried references, and
              converts them to news  links.   Not  recommended  because  email
              addresses  enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to false
              news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

       --ccaacchhee=_N_U_M_B_E_R
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.   The  default  is
              10.

       --ccaassee  enable case-sensitive string searching.

       --cceenntteerr
              toggles  center  alignment  in HTML TABLE.  Normally table cells
              are centered on the table grid.  Set this option "on" to disable
              centering.  The default is "off".

       --ccffgg=_F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E
              specifies  a  _L_y_n_x  configuration  file  other  than the default
              lynx.cfg.

       --cchhiilldd exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save  to  disk  and
              associated print/mail options.

       --cchhiilldd__rreellaaxxeedd
              exit  on  left-arrow  in  startfile,  but allow save to disk and
              associated print/mail options.

       --ccmmdd__lloogg=_F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E
              write  keystroke  commands  and  related  information   to   the
              specified file.

       --ccmmdd__ssccrriipptt=_F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E
              read  keystroke  commands  from the specified file.  You can use
              the data written using the --ccmmdd__lloogg option.   _L_y_n_x  will  ignore
              other  information which the command-logging may have written to
              the logfile.  Each line of the command script contains either  a
              comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

              eexxiitt
                 causes   the   script  to  stop,  and  forces  _L_y_n_x  to  exit
                 immediately.

              kkeeyy
                 the character value, in printable  form.   Cursor  and  other
                 special   keys  are  given  as  names,  e.g.,  "Down  Arrow".
                 Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and  hexadecimal
                 values represent other 8-bit codes.

              sseett
                 followed  by a "name=value" allows one to override values set
                 in the lynx.cfg or .lynxrc files.  _L_y_n_x  tries  the  cfg-file
                 setting first.

       --ccoollllaappssee__bbrr__ttaaggss
              toggles collapsing of BR tags.

       --ccoolloorr forces  color  mode  on,  if  available.   Default color control
              sequences which work for many terminal types are assumed if  the
              terminal  capability  description does not specify how to handle
              color.  _L_y_n_x needs to be compiled with  the  ssllaanngg  library  for
              this flag, it is equivalent to setting the CCOOLLOORRTTEERRMM environment
              variable.  (If color support is instead  provided  by  a  color-
              capable  curses  library like nnccuurrsseess, _L_y_n_x relies completely on
              the terminal description to  determine  whether  color  mode  is
              possible,  and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)  A
              saved show_color=always setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc  file  at
              startup  has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

       --ccoonnnneecctt__ttiimmeeoouutt=_N
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       --ccooookkiiee__ffiillee=_F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.  If none is  specified,
              the  default  value  is  ~/.lynx_cookies  for  most systems, but
              ~/cookies for MS-DOS.

       --ccooookkiiee__ssaavvee__ffiillee=_F_I_L_E_N_A_M_E
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified,
              the value given by --ccooookkiiee__ffiillee is used.

       --ccooookkiieess
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

       --ccoorree  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off
              to ask _L_y_n_x to force a core dump if a fatal error occurs.

       --ccrraawwll with --ttrraavveerrssaall,, output each page to a file.  with --dduummpp, format
              output as with --ttrraavveerrssaall, but to the standard output.

       --ccuurrsseess__ppaaddss
              toggles   the   use  of  curses  "pad"  feature  which  supports
              left/right scrolling of the display.  The  feature  is  normally
              available  for curses configurations, but inactive.  To activate
              it, use  the  "|"  character  or  the  LINEWRAP_TOGGLE  command.
              Toggling this option makes the feature altogether unavailable.

       --ddeebbuugg__ppaarrttiiaall
              separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay

       --ddeeffaauulltt__ccoolloorrss
              toggles  the default-colors feature which is normally set in the
              lynx.cfg file.

       --ddeellaayy add DebugSecs delay after each progress-message

       --ddiissppllaayy=_D_I_S_P_L_A_Y
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

       --ddiissppllaayy__cchhaarrsseett=_M_I_M_E_n_a_m_e
              set the charset for the terminal output.

       --ddoonntt__wwrraapp__pprree
              inhibit wrapping of text when  --dduummpp'ing  and  --ccrraawwll'ing,  mark
              wrapped lines of <pre> in interactive session.

       --dduummpp  dumps  the  formatted  output  of  the default document or those
              specified on  the  command  line  to  standard  output.   Unlike
              interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used
              in the following way:

                  lynx --dduummpp http://www.subir.com/lynx.html

              Files specified on the command line are  formatted  as  HTML  if
              their  names  end  with one of the standard web suffixes such as
              ".htm" or ".html".  Use the --ffoorrccee__hhttmmll option to  format  files
              whose names do not follow this convention.

       --eeddiittoorr=_E_D_I_T_O_R
              enable  external  editing, using the specified EDITOR.  (vi, ed,
              emacs, etc.)

       --eemmaaccsskkeeyyss
              enable emacs-like key movement.

       --eennaabbllee__ssccrroollllbbaacckk
              toggles compatibility with  communication  programs'  scrollback
              keys (may be incompatible with some curses packages).

       --eerrrroorr__ffiillee=_F_I_L_E
              define a file where _L_y_n_x will report HTTP access codes.

       --eexxeecc  enable local program execution (normally not configured).

       --ffiilleevveerrssiioonnss
              include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

       --ffiinndd__lleeaakkss
              toggle memory leak-checking.  Normally this is not compiled-into
              your executable, but when it  is,  it  can  be  disabled  for  a
              session.

       --ffoorrccee__eemmppttyy__hhrreefflleessss__aa
              force  HREF-less "A" elements to be empty (close them as soon as
              they are seen).

       --ffoorrccee__hhttmmll
              forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

              This is most useful  when  processing  files  specified  on  the
              command line which have an unrecognized suffix (or the suffix is
              associated with a non-HTML type, such as ".txt" for  plain  text
              files).

              _L_y_n_x recognizes these file suffixes as HTML:

                  ".ht3",
                  ".htm",
                  ".html3",
                  ".html",
                  ".htmlx",
                  ".php3",
                  ".php",
                  ".phtml",
                  ".sht", and
                  ".shtml".

       --ffoorrccee__sseeccuurree
              toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

       --ffoorrmmss__ooppttiioonnss
              toggles whether the Options Menu is key-based or form-based.

       --ffrroomm  toggles transmissions of From headers.

       --ffttpp   disable ftp access.

       --ggeett__ddaattaa
              properly  formatted  data  for  a  _g_e_t form are read in from the
              standard input and passed to the form.  Input is terminated by a
              line that starts with "---".

              _L_y_n_x  issues  an  HTTP  GGEETT, sending the form to the path or URL
              given on the command-line and prints the response of the server.
              If  no  path  or URL is given, _L_y_n_x sends the form to the start-

              saves session to specified file.

       --sshhoorrtt__uurrll
              show very long URLs in the status line with "..."  to  represent
              the portion which cannot be displayed.  The beginning and end of
              the URL are displayed, rather than suppressing the end.

       --sshhooww__ccffgg
              Print the configuration settings, e.g., as read from "lynx.cfg",
              and exit.

       --sshhooww__ccuurrssoorr
              If  enabled  the  cursor  will  not  be hidden in the right hand
              corner but will instead  be  positioned  at  the  start  of  the
              currently selected link.  Show cursor is the default for systems
              without FANCY_CURSES capabilities.   The  default  configuration
              can  be  changed  in  userdefs.h  or lynx.cfg.  The command line
              switch toggles the default.

       --sshhooww__rraattee
              If enabled the transfer  rate  is  shown  in  bytes/second.   If
              disabled,  no  transfer  rate  is  shown.   Use  lynx.cfg or the
              options menu to select KB/second and/or ETA.

       --ssoocckkss55__pprrooxxyy==UURRLL
              (Via which)  SOCKS5  proxy  to  connect:  any  network  traffic,
              including  all  DNS resolutions but the one for URL itself, will
              be redirected through the SOCKS5 proxy.  URL  may  be  given  as
              "proxy.example.com", "proxy.example.com:1080", "192.168.0.1", or
              "192.168.0.1:1080" (and  IPv6  notation  if  so  supported).   A
              SOCKS5  proxy may also be specified via the environment variable
              SSOOCCKKSS55__PPRROOXXYY..  This option controls the builtin SOCKS5  support,
              which is unrelated to the option --nnoossoocckkss.

       --ssoofftt__ddqquuootteess
              toggles  emulation  of  the  old  Netscape  and Mosaic bug which
              treated ">" as a co-terminator for double-quotes and tags.

       --ssoouurrccee
              works the same as  dump  but  outputs  HTML  source  instead  of
              formatted text.  For example

                  lynx -source . >foo.html

              generates   HTML   source  listing  the  files  in  the  current
              directory.  Each file is marked  by  an  HREF  relative  to  the
              parent  directory.   Add  a  trailing  slash  to make the HREF's
              relative to the current directory:

                  lynx -source ./ >foo.html

       --ssttaacckk__dduummpp
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       --ssttaarrttffiillee__ookk
              allow non-http startfile and homepage with --vvaalliiddaattee.

       --ssttddeerrrr
              When dumping a document using --dduummpp or  --ssoouurrccee,  _L_y_n_x  normally
              does  not  display  alert  (error)  messages that you see on the
              screen in the status line.  Use the --ssttddeerrrr option to tell  _L_y_n_x
              to write these messages to the standard error.

       --ssttddiinn read the startfile from standard input (UNIX only).

       --ssyysslloogg=_t_e_x_t
              information for syslog call.

       --ssyysslloogg__uurrllss
              log requested URLs with syslog.

       --ttaaggssoouupp
              initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather than SortaSGML.

       --tteellnneett
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       --tteerrmm=_T_E_R_M
              tell  _L_y_n_x what terminal type to assume it is talking to.  (This
              may be useful for remote  execution,  when,  for  example,  _L_y_n_x
              connects  to  a remote TCP/IP port that starts a script that, in
              turn, starts another _L_y_n_x process.)

       --ttiimmeeoouutt=_N
              For win32, sets the network read-timeout, where N  is  given  in
              seconds.

       --ttlloogg  toggles  between  using  a  _L_y_n_x  Trace Log and stderr for trace
              output from the session.

       --ttnnaa   turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.

       --ttrraaccee turns on _L_y_n_x trace mode.  Destination of trace  output  depends
              on -tlog.

       --ttrraaccee__mmaasskk=_v_a_l_u_e
              turn  on  optional  traces, which may result in very large trace
              files.  Logically OR the values to combine options:

       --ttrraavveerrssaall
              traverse  all http links derived from startfile.  When used with
              --ccrraawwll, each link that begins with the same string as  startfile
              is output to a file, intended for indexing.

              See CRAWL.announce for more information.

       --ttrriimm__bbllaannkk__lliinneess
              toggles  trimming of trailing blank lines as well as the related
              trimming of blank lines while collapsing BR tags.

       --ttrriimm__iinnppuutt__ffiieellddss

       --uunnddeerrlliinnee__lliinnkkss
              toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.

       --uunnddeerrssccoorree
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       --uunniiqquuee__uurrllss
              check for duplicate link numbers in each page and  corresponding
              lists, and reuse the original link number.

       --uuppddaattee__tteerrmm__ttiittllee
              enables  updating  the title in terminal emulators.  Use only if
              your terminal emulator supports that escape code.  Has no effect
              when used with --nnoottiittllee.

       --uussee__mmoouussee
              turn  on  mouse  support, if available.  Clicking the left mouse
              button on a link traverses it.  Clicking the right mouse  button
              pops  back.   Click  on the top line to scroll up.  Click on the
              bottom line to scroll down.  The first few positions in the  top
              and  bottom  line may invoke additional functions.  _L_y_n_x must be
              compiled with nnccuurrsseess or ssllaanngg  to  support  this  feature.   If
              nnccuurrsseess  is  used,  clicking  the  middle mouse button pops up a
              simple menu.  Mouse clicks may only work reliably while _L_y_n_x  is
              idle waiting for input.

       --uusseerraaggeenntt==NNaammee
              set alternate _L_y_n_x User-Agent header.

       --vvaalliiddaattee
              accept  only  http  URLs  (for  validation).   Complete security
              restrictions also are implemented.

       --vveerrbboossee
              toggle [LINK], [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with  filenames  of
              these images.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              print version information, and exit.

       --vviikkeeyyss
              enable vi-like key movement.

       --wwddeebbuugg
              enable  Waterloo  tcp/ip packet debug (print to watt debugfile).
              This applies only  to  DOS  versions  compiled  with  WATTCP  or
              WATT-32.

       --wwiiddtthh=_N_U_M_B_E_R
              number  of columns for formatting of dumps, default is 80.  This
              is limited by the number of columns  that  _L_y_n_x  could  display,
              typically 1024 (the _M_A_X___L_I_N_E symbol).

       --wwiitthh__bbaacckkssppaacceess
              emit  backspaces  in output if --dduummpp'ing or --ccrraawwll'ing (like mmaann
              does)

       --xxhhttmmll__ppaarrssiinngg
              tells _L_y_n_x that it can ignore certain tags which have no content
              in an XHTML 1.0 document.  For example "<p/>" will be discarded.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       More  than  one key can be mapped to a given command.  Here are some of
       the most useful:

       +o   Use UUpp aarrrrooww and DDoowwnn aarrrrooww to scroll through hypertext links.

       +o   RRiigghhtt aarrrrooww or RReettuurrnn will follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       +o   LLeefftt AArrrrooww or "uu" will retreat from a link.

       +o   Type "HH", "??", or FF11 for online help and descriptions of key-stroke
           commands.

       +o   Type  "kk"  or  "KK"  for  a  list  of the current key-stroke command
           mappings.

           If the same command is mapped to the same letter differing only  by
           upper/lowercase only the lowercase mapping is shown.

       +o   Type DDeelleettee to view history list.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       In  addition  to various "standard" environment variables such as HHOOMMEE,
       PPAATTHH, UUSSEERR, DDIISSPPLLAAYY, TTMMPPDDIIRR, eettcc, _L_y_n_x utilizes  several  _L_y_n_x-specific
       environment variables, if they exist.

       Others  may  be created or modified by _L_y_n_x to pass data to an external
       program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.

       See also the sections on SSIIMMUULLAATTEEDD  CCGGII  SSUUPPPPOORRTT  and  NNAATTIIVVEE  LLAANNGGUUAAGGEE
       SSUUPPPPOORRTT, below.

       Note:   Not  all  environment variables apply to all types of platforms
       supported by _L_y_n_x, though most do.  Feedback on  platform  dependencies
       is solicited.

       Environment Variables Used By _L_y_n_x:

       CCOOLLOORRTTEERRMM           If set, color capability for the terminal is forced
                           on at startup time.  The actual value  assigned  to
                           the  variable  is  ignored.   This variable is only
                           meaningful  if  _L_y_n_x  was  built  using  the  ssllaanngg
                           screen-handling library.

       LLYYNNXX__CCFFGG            This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           location and name of the global configuration  file
                           (normally,   llyynnxx..ccffgg)  that  was  defined  by  the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE  constant  in  the  userdefs.h  file,
                           during installation.

                           See the userdefs.h file for more information.

       LLYYNNXX__CCFFGG__PPAATTHH       If  set,  this  variable  overrides the compiled-in
                           search-list  of  directories  used  to   find   the
                           configuration  files,  e.g., llyynnxx..ccffgg and llyynnxx..llssss.
                           The list is delimited with ":" (or ";" for Windows)
                           like the PPAATTHH environment variable.

       LLYYNNXX__HHEELLPPFFIILLEE       If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in URL
                           and configuration file URL for the _L_y_n_x help file.

       LLYYNNXX__LLOOCCAALLEEDDIIRR      If set, this  variable  overrides  the  compiled-in
                           location  of  the  locale  directory which contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       LLYYNNXX__LLSSSS            This variable, if set, specifies  the  location  of
                           the   default  _L_y_n_x  character  style  sheet  file.
                           [Currently only meaningful if _L_y_n_x was built  using
                           curses color style support.]

       LLYYNNXX__SSAAVVEE__SSPPAACCEE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for files saved to disk that is defined
                           in the llyynnxx..ccffgg SSAAVVEE__SSPPAACCEE:: statement.

                           See the llyynnxx..ccffgg file for more information.

       LLYYNNXX__TTEEMMPP__SSPPAACCEE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for temporary files  that  was  defined
                           during  installation, as well as any value that may
                           be assigned to the TTMMPPDDIIRR variable.

       MMAAIILL                This variable specifies the default inbox _L_y_n_x will
                           check  for new mail, if such checking is enabled in
                           the llyynnxx..ccffgg file.

       NNEEWWSS__OORRGGAANNIIZZAATTIIOONN   This variable, if set, provides the string used  in
                           the  OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn::  header of UUSSEENNEETT news postings.
                           It will override the setting  of  the  ORGANIZATION
                           environment  variable,  if  it is also set (and, on
                           UUNNIIXX, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if
                           present).

       NNNNTTPPSSEERRVVEERR          If  set,  this  variable specifies the default NNTP
                           server that will be used for  UUSSEENNEETT  news  reading
                           and posting with _L_y_n_x, via news: URL's.

       OORRGGAANNIIZZAATTIIOONN        This  variable, if set, provides the string used in
                           the OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn:: header of UUSSEENNEETT  news  postings.
                           On  UUNNIIXX,  it  will  override  the  contents  of an
                           /etc/organization file, if present.

       _P_R_O_T_O_C_O_L__pprrooxxyy      _L_y_n_x supports the use of proxy servers that can act
                           as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
                           preferable  to  the  older  gateway  servers   (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY, below).

                           Each  protocol  used  by  _L_y_n_x, (http, ftp, gopher,
                           etc),  can  be   mapped   separately   by   setting
                           environment  variables  of the form _P_R_O_T_O_C_O_L_proxy.
                           Protocols are indicated in a URI by the name before
                           ":", e.g., "http" in "http://some.server.dom:port/"
                           for HTML.

                           Depending  on   your   system   configuration   and
                           supported   protocols,  the  environment  variables
                           recognized by _l_y_n_x may include

                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  llyynnxx..ccffgg  PPRRIINNTTEERR:: definition statement.  If

       LLYYNNXX__PPRRIINNTT__TTIITTLLEE    This  variable is set by the _L_y_n_x p(rint) function,
                           to the LLiinnkknnaammee::  string  seen  in  the  document's

                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UUNNIIXX, or "No
                           Title" under VVMMSS.

       LLYYNNXX__PPRRIINNTT__UURRLL      This variable is set by the _L_y_n_x p(rint)  function,
                           to   the   UURRLL::   string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn aabboouutt" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a llyynnxx..ccffgg PPRRIINNTTEERR::  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UUNNIIXX, or "No
                           URL" under VVMMSS.

       LLYYNNXX__TTRRAACCEE          If set, causes _L_y_n_x to write a trace file as if the
                           --ttrraaccee option were supplied.

       LLYYNNXX__TTRRAACCEE__FFIILLEE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace
                           file,  which  is  either LLyynnxx..ttrraaccee or LLYY--TTRRAACCEE..LLOOGG
                           (the latter on  the  DOS/Windows  platforms).   The
                           trace  file  is in either case relative to the home
                           directory.

       LLYYNNXX__VVEERRSSIIOONN        This variable is always set by  _L_y_n_x,  and  may  be
                           used  by an external program to determine if it was
                           invoked by _L_y_n_x.

                           See also the comments in the distribution's  sample
                           mmaaiillccaapp file, for notes on usage in such a file.

       TTEERRMM                Normally,   this   variable  is  used  by  _L_y_n_x  to
                           determine the terminal type being  used  to  invoke
                           _L_y_n_x.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or
                           has the value "unknown"), or if the --tteerrmm  command-
                           line  option  is  used (see OOPPTTIIOONNSS section above),
                           _L_y_n_x will set or  modify  its  value  to  the  user
                           specified  terminal  type  (for  the _L_y_n_x execution
                           environment).  Note: If set/modified by  _L_y_n_x,  the
                           values  of  the  LLIINNEESS  and/or  CCOOLLUUMMNNSS environment
                           variables may also be changed.

       If built with the ccggii--lliinnkkss option enabled, _L_y_n_x allows access to a cgi
       script directly without the need for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such  "lynxcgi  scripts"  (if  enabled), the following
       variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:

       CCOONNTTEENNTT__LLEENNGGTTHH

       CCOONNTTEENNTT__TTYYPPEE

       Other environment variables are not inherited  by  the  script,  unless
       they   are   provided   via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement  in  the
       configuration file.  See the llyynnxx..ccffgg file, and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1
       Specification <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt>
       for the definition and usage of these variables.

       The CGI Specification, and other associated  documentation,  should  be
       consulted for general information on CGI script programming.

NNAATTIIVVEE LLAANNGGUUAAGGEE SSUUPPPPOORRTT
       If  configured  and  installed  with NNaattiivvee LLaanngguuaaggee SSuuppppoorrtt, _L_y_n_x will

       AABBOOUUTT__NNLLSS  in  the  source distribution, or at your local GGNNUU site, for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment  variables  may  be  used  to  alter  default
       settings:

       LLAANNGG                This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           message language.  It is an IISSOO 663399 two-letter code
                           identifying  the  language.  Language codes are NNOOTT
                           the same as the country codes given in IISSOO 33116666.

       LLAANNGGUUAAGGEE            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           message language.  This is a GGNNUU extension that has
                           higher priority for  setting  the  message  catalog
                           than LLAANNGG or LLCC__AALLLL.

       LLCC__AALLLL              and

       LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of
                           native language formatting style.  They are PPOOSSIIXXllyy
                           correct.

       LLIINNGGUUAASS             This  variable,  if  set  prior  to  configuration,
                           limits the installed languages to specific  values.
                           It  is  a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
                           Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

       NNLLSSPPAATTHH             This variable, if set, is used as the  path  prefix
                           for message catalogs.

       Note that man page availability and section numbering is somewhat plat-
       form dependent, and may vary from the above references.

       A section shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the topic  may  be
       available via an info page, instead of a man page (i.e., try "info sub-
       ject", rather than "man subject").

       A section shown as ((??)) denotes that documentation on the topic  exists,
       but  is  not part of an established documentation retrieval system (see
       the distribution files associated with the topic, or contact your  Sys-
       tem Administrator for further information).

AACCKKNNOOWWLLEEDDGGMMEENNTTSS
       _L_y_n_x  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.
       The earliest versions of _L_y_n_x included code from Earl Fogel of  Comput-
       ing  Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
       REZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson  of
       Think.com  and  served  as  the  model  for the early versions of _L_y_n_x.
       Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
       developed  at  the  University  of Minnesota, and the later versions of
       _L_y_n_x rely on the WWW client library code developed by  Tim  Berners-Lee
       and  the  WWW  community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
       ported much of _L_y_n_x to VMS and did or organized most of its development
       since  the  departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the Uni-
       versity of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release of  v2.7.2,
