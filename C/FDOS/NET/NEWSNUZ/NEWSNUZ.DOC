                *********** WARNING ************

        This is only a test version of the newsreader, we
        will formally announce it when a working version
        is complete - probably within a week or two.  You
        are free to test it, but do not rely on it yet.

                ********************************

Snuz was a news reader written by Doug MacDonald and had some history with
earlier news readers included in the PCIP distribution.  The new Snuz here
is different from versions you may have seen elsewhere.

1. The new Snuz uses the WATTCP TCP/IP code meaning:
        - you do not need to install NETDEV.SYS drivers into your CONFIG.SYS
        - it supports more modern routing and stuff
        - it works with packet drivers such as those available
          from sun.soe.clarkson.edu or vax.ftp.com
        - it offers acceptable performance

2. Snuz often exhibits absolutely excruciating sluggishness when posting.
   This is a truth of the NNTP server, not of Snuz - you will usually see
   it wait for the acceptance from the server.

3. You can now shell out of Snuz and it won't crash.  WATTCP can easily
   be placed in the background, meaning shelling out to an editor or
   even to the DOS prompt will not stop WATTCP from processing packets.
   If the remote host is a pain and uses keep-alives - no problem.  People
   can also PING your machine while you are shelled out.

   To shell out press '!', other commands can be found by using 'h' or '?'

4. A few slight changes were made to the Snuz application, including the
   use of WATTCP configuration files which can simply Snuz configurations
   for network servers.

                             - - -

To run Snuz you will need to have at least two files around, they are all
easily created with a simple text editor such as edlin or qedit:

   WATTCP.CFG  - should be in the same directory as SNUZ.EXE
                 Here is a sample WATTCP.CFG
        --WATTCP.CFG--------------------------------------------
        my_ip   = 129.97.176.99
        netmask = 255.255.254.0       ; example is a 23 bit subnet
        nameserver = 129.97.129.140   ; a domain name server
        nameserver = 129.97.128.196   ; a secondary name server
        gateway = 129.97.176.1        ; my particular gateway
        domainslist = "waterloo.edu"  ; often useful

        ; snuz specific portion
        ; my user's private disk is n: and the n:\internet subdir is tempspace

        SNUZ.RC=n:\internet\snuz.rc     ; list of subscribed groups, etc
        SNUZ.HOST=129.97.128.196        ; news server ipaddr or dns name
        SNUZ.FROM=joe@mercy.steamroller ; the current user's id
        SNUZ.EDITOR=j:\util\qedit       ; my favourite editor
        SNUZ.SMTP=.\                    ; ignore this for now
        --------------------------------------------------------
               - there are tons of other options such as BOOTP
               - you can specify local override files if you wish
                 by moving portions of the above WATTCP.CFG file into
                 a personal file and using the include directive to
                 chain into the user's personal file.  For example,
                 place the following into the above WATTCP.CFG
                 and you can move the SNUZ.FROM field to a user's
                 personal disk area.
        --------------------------------------------------------
        include = "c:\local.cfg"      ; must include that subfile or error
        include = "?c:\local.cfg"     ; include the file if it exists
        --------------------------------------------------------
               - more configuration details are available via anonymous ftp
                 to 129.97.128.196 in pub/wattcp/apps.zip.


   SNUZ.RC     - tells snuz about your current news subscriptions
               - gets updated whenever you finish Snuz
               - try a sample file like the following
        --SNUZ.RC-----------------------------------------------
        comp.protocols.tcp-ip 1
        comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc 1
        alt.nerds.radioshack 1
        --------------------------------------------------------

I use a simple batch file to run/configure snuz for users, note that I get
their userid from an environment variable and I assume the packet driver
is already loaded.

        --NEWS.BAT----------------------------------------------

        if exist n:\internet\snuz.cfg goto olduser
        echo first time news user... configuring your files
        md n:\internet
        echo news.announce.newusers 0 >  n:\internet\snuz.rc
        echo uw.general 0             >> n:\internet\snuz.rc
        echo SNUZ.FROM=%userid%       >  n:\internet\snuz.cfg

        :olduser
        snuz
        --------------------------------------------------------

That's about all the changes I made so far.  Here is some of Doug's
documentation about the original Snuz.

                                  - - -

Snuz is a simple netnews reading program. It supports reading and posting
News to an NNTP news server and in conjunction with an smtp program
will post mail replies.

Snuz is not "rn" or "nn" or "trn". It doesn't have kill files or threads.
It does allow going to any article in any group. It can save articles to files.

Snuz sometimes says that the host is trying to talk to you at the same
time you are to it, and recommends quitting. Don't quit, just be patient,
it seems to sort itself out.

Snuz.rc lists the newsgroups you wish to read. It has the format of
<newsgroup> <space> <number> (without the <>). Running Snuz with
the argument -S Snuz.rc will generate a file containing all the newgroups
your server has, together with appropriate numbers. These numbers are 
the number of the first article you will read upon entering a group.
You can edit the file produced by "Snuz -S Snuz.rc" to get the groups
you want. You must have at least two good newsgroups listed.

The user interface for Snuz is quite simple. Just enter the program and
type "h" or "?" for a list of commands. If you just keep hitting return
you will progress your way through all your News. One missing item:
you can't back up a page during the reading of a long article. You can
go back to the beginning by typing "=", or you can type F an get put
into your editor, which will presumably allow looking around at will - 
or even searching for things. Just be sure to tell Snuz not to
actually post the article again!! This is done by not answering "y"
to the question asked after your editor exits.

Snuz has a simple mechanism so that you see cross-posted items only once:
they appear only in the newsgroup which appears higher in your snuz.rc file.
This is different from the way some other readers work, where they appear in
the group you actually access first in time. This can be disabled by
the X command.

Snuz has no "post" command. You have to follow-up something. You can 
easily do this by just editing the header. 

The posting and mailing mechanism queues up all you items and processes
them at the end of your session. If you send mail, it spawns the program
"dsmtp.exe" to actually send it; posting is internal. This process,
at least on my news and mail server, is amazingly slow - sometimes five
minutes to send a single mail or news item!

The supplied smtp mail program dsmtp.exe will send mail items independent of 
Snuz if you make a file with appropriate From: myname@a.b.c.d and
To: toname@e.f.g.h lines in the header. Just say "dsmtp filename mailservername".
If you give dsmtp the filename "sendmail.lst", as does Snuz, it considers
that as a list of files to mail, one filename to a line.

Be SURE to get you config file set up so that you give a valid From:
address: if your PC is like mine, mail to it will bounce - a very
unpleasant situation. Put a place that mail WILL reach in your From:
line. Test it by sending mail to yourself.

The parts of Snuz I have written are public domain. It is based on older
things which are freely distributable but not public domain. 

                               - - -

If you have problems, contact one of us and we will hopefully be able to
sort them out.
