    2633 Sitting here wasted
    2793 and wounded at this old piano
    3257 Tryin' hard to capture
    3450 the moment this morning
    3610 I don't know
    3916 'Cause a bottle of vodka's
    4112 still lodged in my head
    4253 And some blond gave me nightmares,
    4473 Think that she's still in my bed
    4909 As I dream about movies
    5095 they won't make of me
    5236 when I'm dead
    5434 
    5584 With an iron-clad fist I wake up
    5840 and French kiss the morning
    6221 While some marching band
    6365 keeps its own beat
    6470 in my head
    6552 While we're talking
    6880 About all of the things
    7053 that I long to believe
    7241 About love, the truth
    7413 and what you mean to me
    7574 And the truth is
    7926 baby, you're all that I need
    8214 
    8345 I want to lay you down
    8646 in a bed of roses
    9024 For tonite I sleep
    9302 on a bed of nails
    9562 Ohh, I want to be
    9852 just as close as
   10040 the Holy Ghost is
   10365 And lay you down
   10784 on a bed of roses
   11027 
   11165 Well I'm so far away
   11363 each step that I take's
   11502 on my way home
   11828 A King's ransom in dimes
   12019 I'd give each night
   12140 to see through this payphone
   12488 Still I run out of time
   12656 or it's hard to get through
   12847 Till the bird on the wire
   13006 flies me back to you
   13183 I'll just close my eyes
   13453 and whisper
   13531 baby, blind love is true
   13781 
   13936 I want to lay you down
   14245 in a bed of roses
   14626 For tonite I sleep
   14897 on a bed of nails
   15173 Ohh, I want to be
   15452 just as close as
   15648 the Holy Ghost is
   15957 And lay you down
   16367 on a bed of roses
   16639 
   16761 Well this hotel bar's hangover
   16979 whiskey's gone dry
   17106 The barkeeper's wig's crooked
   17284 And she's giving me the eye
   17418 Well I might have said yeah
   17741 But I laughed so hard I think I died
   18095 
   18126 Ooww, yah
   18291 
   21025 Now as you close your eyes
   21225 Know I'll be thinking about you
   21657 While my mistress she calls me
   21865 To stand in her spotlight again
   22278 Tonite
   22351 I won't be alone
   22504 But you know that don't mean
   22634 I'm not lonely
   22958 I've got nothing to prove
   23154 For it's you
   23225 that I'd die to defend
   23425 
   23580 I want to lay you down
   23884 in a bed of roses
   24264 For tonite I sleep
   24533 on a bed of nails
   24804 Ohh, I want to be
   25079 just as close as
   25285 the Holy Ghost is
   25586 And lay you down
   25991 
   26198 I want to lay you down
   26494 in a bed of roses
   26873 For tonite I sleep
   27149 on a bed of nails
   27498 I want to be
   27680 just as close as
   27881 the Holy Ghost is
   28184 And lay you down
   28715 on a bed of roses
