    1582 Swept me away
    1747 But now I'm lost in the dark
    2112 Set me on fire
    2247 But now I'm left with a spark
    2595 Alone, you got beyond the haze and
    2904 I'm lost inside the maze
    3178 I guess I'm all alone in love
    3582 
    3777 I look into your eyes
    4034 You turn the other way
    4292 And now I realize
    4582 It's all a game you play
    4809 I hold you in the night
    5077 And wake to find you gone
    5336 You're running out of sight
    5584 It's so hard holding on
    5876 All alone in love
    6282 
    6302 Swept me away
    6436 But now I'm lost in the dark
    6798 Set me on fire
    6957 But now I'm left with a spark
    7293 Alone, you got beyond the haze and
    7612 I'm lost inside the maze
    7877 I guess I'm all alone in love
    8298 
    8437 You haunt me in my dreams
    8734 I'm calling out your name
    9001 I watch you fade away
    9243 Your love is not the same
    9505 I've figured out your style
    9788 To quickly drift apart
   10026 You held me for a while
   10296 Planned it from the start
   10590 All alone in love
   10884 
   11032 Sitting in the dark without you
   11290 How am I supposed to make it
   11471 Through the night
   11926 Baby
   12064 Slowly fall apart without you
   12332 Cry away the hours
   12463 Till the morning light
   13056 
   13099 Swept me away
   13228 But now I'm lost in the dark
   13598 Set me on fire
   13774 But now I'm left with a spark
