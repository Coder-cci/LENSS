; ------
You bought me flowers
and you sold me a line
You gave me compliments
and too much wine
I've played that game ...
I know all the moves

You show emotion
but you hide what you feel
You play the innocent
But I've watched you steal
I rest my case ...
you stand accused

But I must confess
I was quite impressed
You seduced me
with your easy charm
And I must admit
I could fall for it

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need
Make me believe

'Cos if love is out the question
Put a little heart
in your intention
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need ...

You talk in circles
when I need a straight line
You've got your principles
and I've got mine
We all need commitment
That's all I ask
(Is that a crime?)

And I must confess
I was quite impressed
I was losing to your winning ways
But I must resist
there's no point to this

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
I gotta have more than ecstasy
Make me believe
I'm all you'll ever need ...
(Yeah)

'Cos if love is out the question
I just gotta stop
Little point to this affection
I just wanna stop
It makes no sense
to carry on like this
If there's nothing between us
you don't know what you'll miss

No love
There's no love
Baby it's true
There's no love

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection
Baby it's true
'Cos if love is out the question
Put a little heart
in your intension

Gonna stop ... how much longer ??

But if love is out of the question
There's no point to this affection

There's no love
No love

But if love is out of the question
