     732 You and I
     995 follow the trace
    1202 laid by
    1343 people of faith
    1555 and pride
    1729 with hungry eyes
    2011 
    2146 You and I
    2393 could conquer the stars
    2612 if we tried
    2748 or simply live by
    2967 simpler vows
    3132 and let the storm
    3293 go by...
    4179 
    4270 You and I
    4509 have written the book
    4734 line by line
    4863 and the few things it took
    5088 to survive
    5245 was your loving heart
    5445 and mine
    5680 Should you go
    5914 remember these words
    6147 as they show
    6282 just how much I care
    6501 don't you know
    6615 I'll always be there
    6919 
    6975 (I'll always be there)
    7094 There when the world and it's promise
    7306 is failing (I'll always be there)
    7456 There when the frost of it's winter
    7651 is cursing (I'll always be there)
    7803 There when the tears in your eyes
    8005 keep on asking (I'll always be there)
    8333 
    8386 I'll always be there

   10274 You and I
   10517 will follow the trace
   10739 laid by
   10888 people of faith
   11087 and pride
   11267 with angry eyes
   11445 gone blind
   11633 
   11685 You and I
   11931 will show them the light
   12151 we live by
   12283 so never again
   12507 will they try
   12640 to keep us apart
   13330 (I'll always be there)
   13420 
   13451 There when the world and it's promise
   13662 is failing (I'll always be there)
   13815 There when the frost of it's winter
   14012 is cursing (I'll always be there)
