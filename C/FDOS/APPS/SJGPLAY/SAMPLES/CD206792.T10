    6369 Well, who'd you think you're fooling
    6584 You say you're havin' fun
    6786 But you're busy going nowhere
    7011 Just lying in the sun
    7153 
    7221 You tried to be a hero
    7437 Commit the perfect crime
    7645 But the dollar got you dancin'
    7858 And you're runnin' out of time
    8046 
    8075 And you're messin' up the water
    8288 And you're rolling in the wine
    8499 You're poisoning your body
    8718 And you're poisoning your mind
    8928 And you gave me Coca-Cola
    9145 'Cause you said it tasted good
    9358 And you watch your television
    9576 'Cause it tells you that you should
    9747 
    9796 ooh, how can you live in this way
    9944 (why do you think it's so strange)
   10049 You must have something to say
   10158 (tell me why I should change)
   10265 There must be more to this life
   10368 It's time we did something right
   10462 
   10475 I said
   10498 Child of vision
   10938 won't you listen
   11364 Find yourself a
   11788 new ambition
   12035 
   12148 I've heard it all before
   12345 Your saying nothing new
   12538 Well I thought I saw a rainbow
   12761 but I guess it wasn't true
   12972 and you cannot make me listen
   13185 and I cannot make you hear
   13394 So you find your way to heaven
   13604 and I'll meet you when you're there
   13760 
   13822 How can you live in this way
   13972 (why do you think it's so strange)
   14077 You must have something to say
   14189 (tell me why I should change)
   14292 We have no reason to fight
   14390 'cause we both know that we're right
   14461 
   14461 I said
   14532 Child of vision
   14952 won't you listen
   15369 Find yourself a
   15787 new ambition
