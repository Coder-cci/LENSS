Such a state.....

Such a mess,
such a funny feeling
I must confess,
I never felt like this before
Runnin' hot,
runnin' my emotions
Your lovin' shock,
goes through me like an open door
Ooh my heart's in animation
And beating in double time

State of attraction
Somehow you make my body
come alive
My arms wanna hold ya
My lips wanna kiss
Ya make me want to want you

This is strange,
this is all a new thing
What a change,
I know that real life ain't like this
Goin' mad,
I'm goin' past the love zone
I've got it bad,
I've got it so I can't resist
I'm in a deep suspension
A limbo void of time...

State of attraction
You're just a magnet
to this heart of mine
These eyes wanna know ya
These hands wanna touch ya
Cause I'm affected by you...
I'm in a ....

State of attraction
Somehow you make my body come alive
My arms wanna hold ya
My lips wanna kiss
Ya make me want to want you

attraction

This is love science,
a chemical reaction
Ooh baby,
to resist
ain't worth tryin'
Cause once ya start the action

State of attraction
I can't resist
a chain reaction
the first time we kissed
You got me so excited
what can I do
you make me want to want to

State of attraction
attraction, attraction

State of attraction
you're in such a state
and I think you know
that I can hardly wait
you findly mend it  ??????
then your the still
and I just want to show you
exactly how I feel

State of attraction
I'm in a state ...
baby
Arms wanna hold you
lips wanna kiss ya

Im in a ...
State of attraction
Runnin' hot,
runnin' my emotions baby

State of attraction
attraction, attraction
