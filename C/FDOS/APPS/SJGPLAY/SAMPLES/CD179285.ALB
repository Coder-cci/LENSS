@SONG: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
    1668 It was twenty years ago today
    1867 Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play,
    2054 They've been going in and out of style,
    2247 But they're guaranteed to raise a smile,
    2457 So may I introduce to you,
    2639 The act you've known for all these years,
    2840 Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

    7236 
    7313 I don't really want to stop the show,
    7514 But I thought you might like to know,
    7697 That the singer's going to sing a song
    7878 And he wants you all to sing along,
    8071 So let me introduce to you
    8254 The one and only Billy Shears

@SONG: Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
     460 Picture yourself in a boat on a river
     848 With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
    1406 Somebody calls you
    1586 you answer quite slowly
    1800 A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
    2292 
    2426 Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
    2822 towering over your head
    3206 Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
    3514 And she's gone
    3698 
    3784 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    4175 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    4555 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    4939 ah ah
    5089 
    5152 Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
    5527 where rocking horse people
    5703 eat marshmallow pies
    6029 Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
    6407 that grow so incredibly high
    6837 
    7019 Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
    7393 waiting to take you away
    7758 Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
    8060 and you're gone
    8194 
    8322 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    8713 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    9096 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
    9476 ah ah
    9609 
    9671 Picture yourself on a train in a station
   10060 With plasticine porters
   10252 with looking glass ties
   10568 Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
   10949 the girl with kaleidoscope eyes
   11394 
   11543 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   11915 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   12281 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   12654 ah ah
   12831 
   13024 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   13391 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   13760 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   14127 ah ah
   14330 
   14498 Lucy in the sky with diamonds
   14868 Lucy in the sky with diamonds

@SONG: Getting Better
     366 It's getting better all the time
     536 
     640 I used to get mad in my school
     830 (No, I can't complain)
     958 The teachers that taught me weren't cool
    1133 (No, I can't complain)
    1263 Holding me down
    1399 Turning me round
    1563 Filling me up with your rules
    1815 
    1853 I've got to admit it's getting better
    2105 A little better all the time
    2339 (It can't get no worse)
    2454 I have to admit it's getting better
    2711 It's getting better
    2871 since you've been mine
    3101 
    3340 Me used to be angry young man
    3634 Me hiding me head in the sand
    3930 You gave me the word
    4074 I finally heard
    4224 I'm doing the best that I can
    4419 
    4520 I've got to admit it's getting better
    4775 A little better all the time
    4996 (It can't get no worse)
    5111 I have to admit it's getting better
    5361 It's getting better
    5520 since you've been mine
    5658 
    5709 Getting so much better all the time
    6026 It's getting better all the time
    6289 (Better better better)
    6611 It's getting better all the time
    6883 (Better better better)
    7228 
    7463 I used to be cruel to my woman
    7651 I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
    8211 Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
    8451 And I'm doing the best that I can
    8639 
    8788 I admit it's getting better
    9037 A little better
    9158 all the time
    9268 (can't get no worse)
    9376 Yes, I admit it's getting better
    9629 It's getting better
    9785 since you've been mine
    9901 
    9968 Getting so much better all the time
   10288 It's getting better all the time
   10552 (better better better)
   10872 It's getting better all the time
   11141 (better better better)
   11436 Getting so much better all the time

@SONG: Fixing A Hole
     479 I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
     825 And stops my mind from wandering
    1126 Where it will go
    1558 
    1845 I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
    2176 And kept my mind from wandering
    2466 Where it will go
    2921 
    3085 And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
    3352 I'm right
    3443 Where I belong I'm right
    3603 Where I belong
    3693 
    3818 See the people standing there
    3967 who disagree and never win
    4127 And wonder why they don't get in my door
    4363 
    4449 I'm painting my room in a colourful way
    4772 And when my mind is wandering
    5053 There I will go
    5651 Hey hey hey
    5939 Hey
    6263 
    6915 And it really doesn't matter
    7113 if I'm wrong I'm right
    7253 Where I belong I'm right
    7405 Where I belong
    7494 
    7618 Silly people run around
    7760 they worry me
    7837 And never ask me why they don't get past my door
    8107 
    8216 I'm taking the time
    8366 for a number of things
    8536 That weren't important yesterday
    8805 And I still go
    9173 oo oo oo oh oh
    9397 
    9483 I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
    9798 And stops my mind from wandering
   10070 Where it will go
   10390 Where it will go
   10729 I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
   11033 And stops my mind from wandering
   11311 Where it will go

@SONG: She's Leaving Home
     443 Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
    1268 Silently closing her bedroom door
    1693 Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
    2060 She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
    2959 Quietly turning the backdoor key
    3381 Stepping outside she is free
    3589 
    3801 She (We gave her most of our lives)
    4184 is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
    4649 home (We gave her everything money could buy)
    5062 She's leaving home after living alone (bye bye)
    5460 for so many years
    5683 
    5829 Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
    6703 Picks up the letter that's lying there
    7138 Standing alone at the top of the stairs
    7507 She breaks down and cries to her husband
    7893 Daddy, our baby's gone
    8434 Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
    8872 How could she do this to me
    9092 
    9310 She (We never thought of ourselves)
    9691 is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
   10146 home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
   10569 She's leaving home after living alone (bye, bye)
   10923 for so many years
   11206 
   11319 Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
   12185 Waiting to keep the appointment she made
   12612 Meeting a man from the motor trade
   12891 
   13046 She (What did we do that was wrong)
   13422 Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
   13876 Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
   14292 Something inside that was always denied (bye, bye)
   14649 for so many years
   15141 She's leaving home
   15477 (bye, bye)

@SONG: Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite
     504 For the benefit of Mr. Kite
     683 There will be a show tonight on trampoline
    1160 The Hendersons will all be there
    1339 Late of Pablo Fanques Fair
    1500 what a scene!
    1643 Over man and horses hoops and garters
    1828 Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
    2127 In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
    2459 
    2771 The celebrated Mr. K
    2936 performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
    3416 The Hendersons will dance and sing
    3577 As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
    3749 don't be late!
    3884 Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
    4064 their production will be second to none
    4362 And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
    5596 
    6671 The band begins at ten to six
    6838 When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
    7325 And Mr. H. will demonstrate
    7475 Ten summersets he'll undertake
    7629 on solid ground
    7797 We've been some days in preparation
    7963 A splendid time is guaranteed for all
    8282 And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

@SONG: Within You Without You
    2388 We were talking
    2700 about the space between us all
    3263 And the people
    3595 who hide themselves behind a wall
    4162 of illusion
    4450 Never glimpse the truth
    4742 then it's far too late
    4994 when they pass away
    5322 
    5674 We were talking
    5963 about the love we all could share
    6501 When we find it
    6822 to try our best to hold it there
    7369 with our love
    7528 With our love
    7647 we could save the world
    7941 if they only knew
    8413 
    8930 Try to realise it's all within yourself
    9309 no-one else can make you change
    9831 And to see you're really only very small
   10206 And life flows on within you and without you
   10849 
   17115 We were talking
   17379 about the love that's gone so cold
   17900 And the people
   18206 who gain the world and lose their soul
   18727 They don't know
   19006 they can't see
   19279 are you one of them?
   20066 
   20539 When you've seen beyond yourself
   20744 then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
   21298 And the time will come when you see we're all one
   21746 And life flows on within you and without you.

@SONG: When I'm Sixty-four
     804 When I get older losing my hair
    1066 Many years from now
    1328 Will you still be sending me a Valentine
    1589 Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
    1767 
    1848 If I'd been out till quarter to three
    2104 Would you lock the door?
    2361 Will you still need me, will you still feed me
    2622 When I'm sixty-four?
    2928 
    3380 You'll be older too
    4021 And if you say the word
    4400 I could stay with you
    4949 
    5041 I could be handy mending a fuse
    5300 When your lights have gone
    5556 You can knit a sweater by the fireside
    5810 Sunday mornings go for a ride
    6021 
    6068 Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
    6317 Who could ask for more?
    6570 Will you still need me
    6699 will you still feed me
    6827 When I'm sixty-four?
    7046 
    7080 Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
    7371 if it's not too dear
    7588 We shall scrimp and save (we shall scrimp and save)
    8223 Grandchildren on your knee
    8597 Vera, Chuck & Dave
    9107 
    9235 Send me a postcard, drop me a line
    9497 stating point of view
    9751 Indicate precisely what you mean to say
   10015 Yours sincerely, wasting away
   10140 
   10258 Give me your answer, fill in a form
   10525 Mine for evermore
   10765 Will you still need me
   10891 will you still feed me
   11016 When I'm sixty-four?

@SONG: Lovely Rita
     841 Lovely Rita meter maid
    1254 Lovely Rita meter maid
    1521 
    1661 Lovely Rita meter maid
    1870 nothing can come between us
    2108 when it gets dark I tow your heart away
    2516 Standing by a parking meter
    2723 when I caught a glimpse of Rita
    2897 Filling in the ticket in her little white book
    3056 
    3137 In a cap she looked much older
    3341 And the bag across her shoulder
    3518 made her look a little like a military man
    3732 
    3930 Lovely Rita meter maid
    4147 may I inquire discreetly
    4349 When you are free to take some tea with me
    4758 
    5352 Rita!
    5922 
    6224 Took her out
    6294 and tried to win her,
    6428 Had a laugh
    6497 and over dinner
    6603 Told her I would really like to see her again
    6761 
    6840 Got the bill
    6906 and Rita paid it
    7044 Took her home
    7106 I nearly made it
    7221 Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
    7411 
    7566 Oh
    7634 Lovely Rita meter maid
    7844 where would I be without you?
    8051 Give us a wink and make me think of you
    8220 
    8256 Lovely Rita meter maid
    8664 Lovely Rita meter maid
    9069 Lovely Rita meter maid
    9478 Lovely Rita meter maid

    3111 then you're in town
    3372 Everybody knows there's nothing doing
    3518 Everything is closed

    3667 Everyone you see is half asleep
    3823 And you're on your own
    3897 you're in the street
    4009 
    4097 After a while
    4185 you start to smile
    4298 now you feel cool
    4474 Then you decide
    4563 to take a walk
    4673 by the old school
    4907 Nothing has changed
    5006 it's still the same
    5167 I've got nothing to say
    5320 but it's OK.
    5377 
    5444 Good morning, good morning

    6745 Everywhere in town it's getting dark,
    6889 Everyone you see is full of life,
    7037 It's time for tea and meet the wife
    7204 
    7312 Somebody needs to know the time
    7512 glad that I'm here
    7681 Watching the skirts
    7779 you start to flirt
    7882 now you're in gear
    8121 Go to a show
    8214 you hope she goes

    1450 About a lucky man
    1626 who made the grade
    1913 And though the news was rather sad
    2382 Well I just had to laugh
    2853 I saw the photograph
    3322 He blew his mind out in a car
    3781 He didn't notice that the lights had changed
    4249 A crowd of people stood and stared
    4709 They'd seen his face before
    4912 Nobody was realy sure
    5019 that he was from the House of Lords
    5364 
    5402 I saw a film today
    5580 Oh boy
    5870 The English Army had just won the war
    6320 A crowd of people turned away
    6779 But I just had to look
    7038 having read the book
    7416 I'd love to turn you on
   10141 
   10547 Woke up
   10689 Fell out of bed
   10801 Dragged a comb across my head
   11132 Found my way downstairs
   11249 and drank a cup
   11363 And looking up
   11480 I noticed I was late
   11672 Found my coat
   11752 and grabbed my hat
   11895 Made the bus
   11972 in seconds flat
   12222 Found my way upstairs
   12344 and had a smoke
   12456 And somebody spoke
   12546 And I went into a dream
   12661

   15345 Four thousand holes in
   15485 Blackburn, Lancashire
   15794 And though the holes were rather small
   16230 they had to count them all
   16421 Now they know how many holes
   16524 it takes to fill the Albert Hall
