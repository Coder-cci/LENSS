When I see you
in the morning
that ol' sleep
still in your eyes
I remembered
all the laughter
and the tears
we shared last night
and as we lie here
just two shadows
in the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing
I've ever know
is loving you

And I have never
been afraid of
losing
and I have never
wanted love to be a chain
I only know that
when I'm with you
your my sunshine
your my rain
The sweetest thing
I've ever known
is loving you

Now you and I
we're not children
we have both
been loved before
we have given
and we have taken
many rides
on troubled shores
but all the heartaches
and temptations
only make me
love you more
The sweetest thing
I've ever known
is loving you

And I have never
been afraid of
losing
and I have never
wanted love to be a chain
I only know that
when I'm with you
your my sunshine
your my rain
The sweetest thing
I've ever known
is loving you

The sweetest thing
I've ever known
is loving you
