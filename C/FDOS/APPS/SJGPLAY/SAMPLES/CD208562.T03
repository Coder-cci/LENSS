    3163 In this proud land we grew up strong
    3449 we were wanted all along
    3781 I was taught to fight,
    3949 taught to win
    4087 I never thought I could fail
    4506 no fight left or so it seems
    4731 I am a man whose dreams
    4883 have all deserted
    5093 I've changed my face,
    5259 I've changed my name,
    5424 but no-one wants you
    5619 when you lose
    5959 
    5959 Don't give up
    6124 'cos you have friends
    6623 Don't give up
    6794 you're not beaten yet
    7294 Don't give up
    7490 I know you can make it good
    7848 
    7848 Though I saw it all around
    8074 never thought that I could be affected
    8465 Thought that we'd
    8603 be last to go
    8769 It is so strange the way
    8966 things turn
    9189 drove the night toward my home
    9400 the place that I was born,
    9578 on the lakeside
    9776 As daylight broke,
    9942 I saw the earth
   10107 the trees had burned down
   10303 to the ground
   10641 
   10641 Don't give up
   10820 you still have us
   11307 Don't give up
   11473 we don't need much
   11660 of anything
   11979 Don't give up
   12146 'cos somewhere there's a place
   12462 where we belong
   12813 rest your head
   13125 you worry too much
   13450 it's gonna be alright
   13842 when times get rough
   14121 you can fall back on us
   14517 Don't give up
   14768 Please don't give up
   15153 
   15153 Got to walk out of here
   15491 I can't take anymore
   15823 Gonna stand on that bridge
   16154 keep my eyes down below
   16513 Whatever may come
   16808 and whatever may go
   17141 that river's flowing
   17471 that river's flowing
   17883 
   17883 Moved onto another town
   18133 tried hard to settle down
   18469 for every job, so many men
   18807 so many men no-one needs
   19340 
   19340 Don't give up
   19529 'cos you have friends
   20004 Don't give up
   20198 you're not the only one
   20670 Don't give up
   20864 no reason to be ashamed
   21337 Don't give up
   21515 you still have us
   22012 Don't give up now
   22207 we're proud of who you are
   22690 Don't give up
   22819 you know it's never been easy
   23350 Don't give up
   23491 'cos I believe there's a place
   23908 There's a place where we belong
