    1759 Taken in
    1910 Taken in again
    2102 Wrapped around the finger of some
    2307 fair-weather friend
    2494 Caught up in the promises
    2690 left out in the end
    2931 No pride
    3073 Taken for a ride
    3268 You say I'm the only one
    3438 when I look in your eyes
    3657 I want to believe you
    3830 but you know how to lie
    4006 
    4743 And if you say you understand
    4939 I don't believe it
    5130 And when you reach out for my hand
    5325 I don't believe it
    5524 And if you say you take the blame
    5713 I don't believe it
    5904 And if you say that nothing's changed
    6099 I don't believe it
    6218 Don't believe it
    6357 
    7572 Taken in
    7720 Taken in again
    7915 Someone saw me coming
    8085 A fool without a friend
    8283 There's one born every minute
    8449 and you're looking at him
    8736 
    9393 And if you say you want me near
    9583 I don't believe it
    9777 And when you're holding back the tears
    9971 I don't believe it
   10163 And when you swear that you are mine
   10358 I don't believe it
   10551 And it's your heart that's on the line
   10745 I don't believe it
   10864 Don't believe it
