    1019 The dining room fell silent
    1178 I can't believe what I just said
    1401 I just told my dad he's full of it
    1636 And I watched his face turn red
    1839 Well then I should have said I'm sorry
    2066 But I matched him shout for shout
    2277 And I can still hear that screen door slammin'
    2513 The night I called him out
    2743 
    2799 And he said
    2860 Son, it's gonna hurt me
    3080 more than it hurts you
    3256 But somehow I couldn't help
    3432 but have my doubts
    3698 Cause I'd seen my older brothers
    3945 crawl back in the house
    4144 each time they called the old man out
    4561 
    4853 Fist to fist
    4914 and eye to eye
    5060 Standin' toe to toe
    5271 He would've let me walk away
    5451 but I just could not let it go
    5693 Years of my frustration
    5894 had led me to this night
    6085 Now he'll pay for all the times
    6274 that he's been right
    6495 
    6516 He said
    6570 Son, it's gonna hurt me
    6787 more than it hurts you
    6969 But somehow I couldn't help
    7139 but have my doubts
    7404 Cause I'd seen my older brothers
    7641 crawl back in the house
    7844 each time they called the old man out
    8210 
    8934 It was over in a minute
    9152 And that's when I realized
    9390 The blood came from my mouth and nose
    9584 but the tears came from his eyes
    9814 And in memory of that fateful night
   10014 I know the greatest pain was his
   10191 and I just pray some day
   10342 I'm half the man he is
   10612 
   10621 And he said
   10701 Son, it's gonna hurt me
   10912 more than it hurts you
   11094 But somehow I couldn't help
   11266 but have my doubts
   11526 Cause I'd seen my older brothers
   11768 crawl back in the house
   11969 each time they called the old man out
   12288 
   12400 Just like my older brothers
   12629 I crawled back in the house
   12840 the night I called the old man out
