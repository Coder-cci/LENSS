     706 If I could recapture
    1242 All of the memories
    1418 And bring them to life
    1646 Surely I would
    1851 Hear the distant laughter
    2400 Wasn't it you and me
    2574 Surviving the night
    2834 You're fading out of my sight
    3076 Swiftly
    3201 
    3268 You're vanishing
    3532 Drifting away
    3852 You're vanishing
    4075 oooooooo....
    4304 
    4496 I was so enraptured
    5060 No sensibility
    5242 To open my eyes
    5486 I misunderstood
    5704 Now you're fading faster
    6200 It's suddenly hard to see
    6422 You're taking the light
    6669 Letting the shadows inside
    6899 Swiftly
    7010 
    7090 You're vanishing
    7332 Drifting away
    7640 You're vanishing
    7903 oooooooo....
    8316 You're vanishing
    8517 Drifting away
    8829 You're ......
    9020 
    9747 Reaching out into the distance
   10302 Searching for spirits of the past
   10889 Just a trace of your existence
   11327 to grasp
   12038 And if somehow I could recapture
   12550 All of the memories
   12761 And bring them to life
   12976 Lord knows I would
   13243 But now you're fading faster
   13724 Getting so hard to see
   13925 Taking the light
   14154 Letting the darkness inside
   14384 Swiftly
   14480 
   14511 You're vanishing
   14759 Drifting away
   15070 You're vanishing
   15302 oooooooo....
   15623 You're vanishing
   15880 Drifting so far away
   16234 your............
   16841 vanishing
   17277 OOOoooooooo....  yeah
   17785 away
