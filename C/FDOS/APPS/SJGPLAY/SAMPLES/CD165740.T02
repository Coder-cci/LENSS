     286 Day after day
     553 alone on the hill,
     804 The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
    1329 But nobody wants to know him,
    1550 They can see that he's just a fool,
    1819 And he never gives an answer,
    2018 But the fool on the hill
    2264 Sees the sun going down,
    2522 And the eyes in his head,
    2770 See the world spinning around.
    3156 
    3331 Well on the way,
    3548 his head in a cloud,
    3817 The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
    4300 But nobody ever hears him,
    4520 Or the sound he appears to make,
    4804 And he never seems to notice,
    4951 
    5010 But the fool on the hill
    5255 Sees the sun going down,
    5508 And the eyes in his head,
    5750 See the world spinning around.
    6922 
    7272 And nobody seems to like him
    7503 They can tell what he wants to do.
    7784 And he never shows his feelings,
    7915 
    7984 But the fool on the hill
    8234 Sees the sun going down,
    8487 And the eyes in his head,
    8730 See the world spinning around.
    9093 
    9216 Oh oh...
    9780 Round and round and
    9901 Round and round
   10000 and round
   10161 
   10275 He never listens to them
   10510 He knows that they're the fool
   10832 They don't like him
   10987 The fool on the hill
   11204 Sees the sun going down,
   11454 And the eyes in his head,
   11690 See the world spinning around.
   11951 
   12274 Ohhh
   12495 Oh oh...
   12528 Round and round and
   12720 Round and round
   12754 and round
