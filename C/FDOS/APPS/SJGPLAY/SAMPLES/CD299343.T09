    5494 FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS
    5689 MANKIND LIVED
    5823 JUST LIKE THE ANIMALS
    6225 THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED
    6360 WHICH UNLEASHED
    6439 THE POWER OF OUR IMAGINATION
    6625 WE LEARNED TO TALK
    6791 
    6800 There's a silence surrounding me
    7179 I can't seem to think straight
    7523 I sit in the corner
    7862 and no one can bother me
    8239 I think I should speak now
    8443 (why won't you talk to me)
    8619 I can't seem to speak now
    8789 (you never talk to me)
    8965 My words won't come out right
    9155 (what are you thinking)
    9321 I feel like I'm drowning
    9521 (what are you feeling)
    9679 I'm feeling weak now
    9879 (why won't you talk to me)
   10045 But I can't show my weakness
   10239 (you never talk to me)
   10430 I sometimes wonder
   10596 (what are you thinking)
   10775 Where do we go from here
   10965 (what are you feeling)
   11115 
   11874 IT DOESN'T HAVE
   11967 TO BE LIKE THIS
   12150 ALL WE NEED TO DO
   12316 IS MAKE SURE
   12461 WE KEEP TALKING
   12548 
   18357 (Why won't you talk to me)
   18495 I feel like I'm drowning
   18680 (You never talk to me)
   18846 You know I can't breathe now
   19045 (What are you thinking)
   19223 We're going nowhere
   19398 (What are you feeling)
   19570 We're going nowhere
   19761 (Why won't you talk to me)
   20118 (You never talk to me)
   20472 (What are you thinking)
   21013 (Where do we go from here)
   21731 
   22094 IT DOESN'T HAVE
   22159 TO BE LIKE THIS
   22347 
   23425 ALL WE NEED TO DO
   23691 IS MAKE SURE
   23857 WE KEEP
   23977 TALKING
