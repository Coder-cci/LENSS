    6520 Here's a story I've been told
    6709 About a child of 12 years old
    6909 Breathing life to young trees falling
    7273 Before the barbed wire on the plain
    7466 before the white man ever came
    7647 She must have saved 10,000 souls
    8031 she was the keeper of the young
    8225 the ones whose lives have just begun
    8414 the ones to die their song unsung

   10490 The story tells of how she cried
   10687 The day the wind blew high the fire
   10890 left her burnt but still undompted
   11254 Across the lake lived magic team
   11448 who set a task for Malicete
   11637 To find the special girl he wanted
   12040 When all the village girls had tried
   12207 to win his heart
   12298 to be his bride
   12402 Oochi would not be denied

   16784 Not as simple as it seemed
   16948 she had to see the one unseen
   17129 she had to cast away the lies
   17504 With courage Oochigeas tried
   17706 forgot the pain
   17797 forgot the cries
   17897 and thus she kept the dream alive
