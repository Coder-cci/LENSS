@SONG: Maxwell's Silver Hammer
      50 Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
     310 Science in the home
     580 Late nights all alone with a test-tube
     859 Ohh-oh-oh-oh...
    1132 Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
    1405 Calls her on the phone
    1681 "Can I take you out to the pictures
    1959 Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
    2224 But as she's getting ready to go
    2496 A knock comes on the door...
    2687 
    2775 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
    3012 Came down upon her head
    3322 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
    3556 Made sure that she was dead
    4343 
    4428 Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
    4699 Teacher gets annoyed
    4977 Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
    5518 She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
    5791 So he waits behind
    6067 Writing 50 times "I must not be so-o-o-oo..."
    6611 But when she turns her back on the boy
    6884 He creeps up from behind
    7096 
    7162 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
    7400 Came down upon her head
    7703 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
    7938 Made sure that she was dead
    9750 
    9888 P.C. Thirty-One said "we caught a dirty one"
   10164 Maxwell stands alone
   10440 Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh
   10983 Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
   11262 Say he must go free   (Maxwell must go free)
   11524 The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo
   12073 But as the words are leaving his lips
   12347 A noise comes from behind
   12529 
   12625 Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
   12902 Came down upon his head
   13169 Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
   13400 Made sure that he was dead

@SONG: Octopus's Garden
     813 I'd like to be under the sea
    1158 In an octopus's garden in the shade
    1599 He'd let us in, knows where we've been
    1947 In his octopus' garden in the shade
    2311 
    2388 I'd ask my friends to come and see
    2780 An octopus's garden with me
    3177 I'd like to be under the sea
    3514 In an octopus's garden in the shade.
    3873 
    3953 We would be warm below the storm
    4300 In our little hideaway beneath the waves
    4744 Resting our head on the sea bed
    5089 In an octopus's garden near a cave
    5398 
    5550 We would sing and dance around
    5920 because we know we can't be found
    6309 I'd like to be under the sea
    6651 In an octopus's garden in the shade
    8505 
    8657 We would shout and swim about
    8974 The coral that lies beneath the waves
    9223 (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
    9438 Oh what joy, for every girl and boy
    9775 Knowing they're happy and they're safe
   10001 (Happy and they're safe)
   10163 
   10216 We would be so happy you and me
   10558 No one there to tell us what to do
   10974 I'd like to be under the sea
   11316 In an octopus's garden with you
   11534 
   11697 In an octopus's garden with you
   12078 In an octopus's garden with you
