     441 Our life
     592 together
     736 Is so precious
     905 together
    1071 We have grown
    1395 We have grown
    1658 
    1704 Although our love
    1933 is still special
    2302 let's take a chance
    2502 and fly away
    2750 somewhere
    2986 alone
    3141 
    3201 It's been too long
    3266 since we took the time
    3386 No-ones to blame
    3483 I know time flies
    3561 so quickly
    3682 
    3985 But when I see you darling
    4350 It's like
    4440 we both are falling
    4644 in love again
    4827 It'll be
    4921 just like starting over
    5211 (over)
    5371 starting over
    5633 
    5719 Every day we used to make love
    5911 Why can't we be makin' love
    6085 nice and easy?
    6520 It's time to spread our wings
    6789 and fly
    6883 Don't let another day
    7158 go by my love
    7355 It'll be
    7449 just like starting over
    7899 starting over
    8157 
    8315 Why don't we take off alone
    8711 Take a trip somewhere
    8827 far far away
    9042 We'd be together
    9185 all alone again
    9454 like we used to
    9545 in the early days.
    9756 Well, well darling
    9883 
    9924 It's been too long
    9997 since we took the time
   10095 No-ones to blame
   10190 I know time flies
   10266 so quickly
   10432 
   10704 But when I see you darling
   11072 It's like
   11162 we both are falling
   11367 in love again
   11546 It'll be
   11642 just like
   11682 starting over
   11932 (over)
   12074 starting over
   12303 
   12360 look out
   12431 
   12455 Our life
   12646 together
   12813 Is so precious
   13010 together
   13184 We have grown
   13441 mmmm
   13548 We have grown
   13758 
   13868 Although our love
   14071 is still special
   14480 let's take a chance
   14603 and fly away
   14799 somewhere
   15378 
   15821 over and over and over
   16156 starting over
   16495 oooo
