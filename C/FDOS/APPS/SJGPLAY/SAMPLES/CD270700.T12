      10 Shattered dreams
     329 Worthless years
     558 Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
    1223 Life began
    1528 then was done
    1757 Now I stare into a cold and empty well
    2417 The many sounds that meet our ears
    2705 The sights our eyes behold
    3013 Will open up our merging hearts
    3310 and feed our empty souls
    3561 
    3811 I believe when I fall in love with you
    4111 it will be forever
    4410 I believe when I fall in love this time
    4713 it will be forever
    4928 
    4966 Without despair
    5277 we will share
    5508 and the joys of caring
    5706 will not be replaced
    6174 What has been
    6452 must never end
    6697 And with the strength we have won't be erased
    7354 When the truths of love
    7501 are planted firm
    7654 they won't be hard to find
    7959 And the words of love
    8105 I speak to you
    8278 will echo in my mind
    8492 
    8759 I believe when I fall in love with you
    9062 it will be forever
    9361 I believe when I fall in love this time
    9694 it will be forever
    9854 
    9963 I believe when I fall in love with you
   10258 it will be forever
   10561 I believe when I fall in love this time
   10864 it will be forever
   11073 
   11254 For ever
   11392 
   11463 I believe when I fall in love with you
   11760 it will be forever
   11911 (forever)
   12063 I believe when I fall in love this time
   12363 it will be forever
   12478 (it will be forever)
   12577 
   12663 I believe when I fall in love with you
   12960 it will be forever
   13079 (it will be forever)
   13262 I believe when I fall in love this time
   13545 (this time)
   13600 it will be forever
   13696 (this time will be forever)
