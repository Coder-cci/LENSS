I know that there's a reason
why I need to be alone
Show me there's a silent place
that I can call my own
Is it mine,
Lord is it mine?

When everything's dark and nothing seems right,
there's nothing to win and there's no need to fight

I never cease to wonder at the cruelty of this land
but it seems a time of sadness is a time to understand
Is it mine, Lord is it mine?

   When everything's dark and nothing seems right,
   You don't have to win and there's no need to fight

If only I could find a way
to feel your sweetness through the day
The love that shines around me could be mine.
So give us an answer, won't you,
We know what we have to do,
There must be a thousand voices trying to get through.
