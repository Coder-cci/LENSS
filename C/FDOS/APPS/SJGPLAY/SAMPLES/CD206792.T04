     558 Take a look at my girlfriend
     770 She's the only one I got
    1036 Not much of a girlfriend
    1249 Never seem to get a lot
    1383 
    1518 Take a jumbo across the water
    1722 Like to see America
    1986 See the girls in
    2105 California

    2414 But there's not a lot I can do

    3825 I'm a winner,
    3943 I'm a sinner
    4033 Do you want my autograph?
    4302 I'm a loser,
    4408 Oh, what a joker
    4502 I'm playing my jokes upon you
    4728 While there's nothing better to do

    7239 Not much of a girlfriend
    7451 Never seem to get a lot
    7572 (what's she got? Not a lot)

    7721 Take a jumbo cross the water
