    1378 And all the birds in the trees
    1537 well they'd be singing so happily
    1812 oh, joyfully
    1928 oh, playfully watching me
    2136 
    2318 But then they sent me away
    2472 to teach me how to be sensible
    2757 logical
    2853 oh, responsible
    2989 practical
    3058

    3241 where I could be so dependable

   10166 when all the world's asleep
