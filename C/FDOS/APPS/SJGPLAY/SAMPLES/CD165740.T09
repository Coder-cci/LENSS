      86 In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
     352 Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
     677 And all the people that come and go
     993 Stop and say hello
    1205 
    1325 On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
    1638 The little children laugh at him behind his back
    1966 And the banker never wears a mack
    2266 In the pouring rain
    2479 very strange
    2553 
    2602 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
    3272 There beneath the blue suburban skies
    3620 I sit, and meanwhile back
    3779 
    3854 In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
    4178 And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
    4483 He likes to keep his fire engine clean
    4819 It's a clean machine
    5016 
    6403 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
    7142 A four of fish and finger pies
    7429 In summer, meanwhile back
    7622 
    7664 Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
    7979 The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
    8295 And tho' she feels as if she's in a play
    8605 She is anyway
    8824 
    8930 In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
    9249 We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
    9572 And then the fireman rushes in
    9874 From the pouring rain
   10085 very strange
   10160 
   10215 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
   10884 There beneath the blue suburban skies
   11239 I sit, and meanwhile back
   11477 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
   12146 There beneath the blue suburban skies
   12694 Penny Lane
