    1216 I had it all
    1386 But I let it slip away
    1785 Couldn't see I treated you wrong
    2311 Now I wander around
    2527 Feeling down and cold
    2923 Trying to believe that you're gone
    3302 
    3419 Love takes time
    3674 To heal when you're hurting so much
    3929 Couldn't see that I was blind
    4251 To let you go
    4467 I can't escape the pain
    4663 Inside
    4814 'Cause love takes time
    5223 I don't wanna be here
    5502 I don't wanna be here alone
    5948 
    6359 Losing my mind
    6512 From this hollow in my heart
    6911 Suddenly I'm so incomplete
    7418 Lord I'm needing you now
    7663 Tell me how to stop the rain
    8063 Tears are falling down endlessly
    8418 Oh ohhhh
    8575 
    8534 Love takes time
    8815 To heal when you're hurting so much
    9060 Couldn't see that I was blind
    9396 To let you go
    9590 I can't escape the pain
    9804 Inside
    9947 'cause love takes time
   10330 And I don't wanna be here
   10620 I don't wanna be here alone
   11171 
   11216 You might say that it's over
   11786 You might say that you don't care
   12185 ohhhhh
   12352 You might say you don't miss me
   12629 You don't need me
   12788 But I know that you do
   12941 and I feel that you do
   13114 Inside
   13312 
   13433 Love takes time
   13695 To heal when you're hurting so much
   13937 Couldn't see that I
   14096 I was so blind
   14247 To let you go
   14468 I can't escape the pain
   14670 Inside
   14834 'cause love takes time
   15220 I don't wanna be there
   15500 I don't wanna be there alone
   15944 
   15887 ohhhhhh
