     800 Our house had the biggest patio
    1095 Our house had all the summer shade
    1530 We had patio lanterns
    1970 I spent half the night making
    2150 lemonade
    2275 Which we drank a lot cause we were
    2450 all so shy
    2740 Shy and nervous
    3150 Who was gonna be
    3345 who would be
    3345 the first to dance
    3440 Who was gonna be
    3645 who would be
    3645 the first to kiss
    3720 Under those patio lanterns
    4485 Those patio lanterns
    4650 they were the stars in the sky
    5060 Those patio lanterns
    5330 Lighting up our lives
    5650 Those patio lanterns
    5820 they were the stars in the sky
    6240 Those patio lanterns
    6430 Lighting up our lives
    6690 oh those patio lanterns
    7420 And I was stuck on Joy,
    7595 That was her name.
    7710 Didn't talk much,
    7820 she was a nervous girl,
    8170 I was a nervous boy.
    8600 We stuck together
    8730 like glue on glue.
    8900 Dance to that old song
    9000 Bobby Vinton's Blue on Blue,
    9365 Heartache on Heartache
    9770 Who was gonna be,
    9876 Who would be the first to dance
   10070 Who was gonna be
   10260 who would be the first to kiss...
   10350 Under those patio lanterns
   11100 Those patio lanterns
   11270 they were the stars in the sky
   11680 Those patio lanterns
   11935 Lighting up our lives
   12280 Those patio lanterns
   12470 they were the stars in the sky
   12860 Those patio lanterns
   13050 Lighting up our lives
   13310 Oh those patio lanterns.
