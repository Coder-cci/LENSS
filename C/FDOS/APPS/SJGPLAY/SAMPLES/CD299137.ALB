@SONG: Ain't Goin' Down (Til The Sun Comes Up)
     985 Six o'clock on friday evenin'
    1092 Mama didn't know she's leavin'
    1198 'Til she hears the screen door slammin'
    1300 Rubber squeelin' gears are jammin'
    1406 Local country station
    1481 Just a 'blarin' on the radio
    1615 Pick him up at seven
    1710 Then they're heading to the rodeo
    1825 Mama's on the front porch
    1933 Screamin' out her warnin'
    2012 "Girl you better get your
    2087 red head back in bed
    2187 before the mornin'"
    2639 
    2677 Nine o'clock the show is endin'
    2783 but the fun is just beginnin'
    2890 She knows he's anticipatin'
    2997 but she's gonna to keep him waitin'
    3102 Grab a bite to eat
    3171 and then they're headin' to the honky-tonk
    3302 But loud crowds and line dancin'
    3422 just ain't what they really want
    3530 Drive out to the boondocks
    3631 and park down by the creek
    3706 Eh, where it's George Strait
    3800 and real late
    3841 and dancin' cheek to cheek
    3926 
    4163 Ain't goin' down
    4240 'til the sun comes up
    4366 Ain't givin' in
    4440 'til they get enough
    4595 Goin' round the world
    4677 in a pickup truck
    4970 Ain't goin' down
    5048 'til the sun comes up
    5164 
    6454 Ten to twelve
    6498 its wine and dancin'
    6563 Midnight starts
    6596 a hard romancin'
    6668 One o'clock
    6715 that truck is rockin'
    6771 Two is comin'
    6823 still no stoppin'
    6878 Break'n check the clock at three
    6971 they're right on where
    7033 They want to be
    7077 and four o'clock
    7132 get up and go
    7186 and five o'clock the rooster's crow
    8014 
    8535 Ya, ain't goin' down

    9639 
    9988 Six o'clock on Saturday

   10150 he's on his way
   10195 The stalls are clean
   10250 the horses fed
   10296 They say she's grounded
   10354 'til she's dead
   10404 Well here he comes
   10450 around the bend
   10514 slowin' down

@SONG: Friends In Low Places
     719 Blame it all on my roots
     902 I showed up in boots
    1076 and ruined your
    1166 black tie affair
    1319 
    1416 the last one to know
    1594 the last one to show
    1721 I was the last one
    1837 you thought you'd see there
    2045 
    2094 And I saw the suprise
    2270 and the fear in his eyes
    2438 when I took his
    2532 glass of champagne
    2778 And I toasted you
    2904 said "Honey, we may be through
    3128 but you'll never hear me complain"
    3437 
    3457 'Cause I've got friends
    3615 in low places
    3780 where the whiskey drowns
    3957 and the beer chases
    4111 my blues away
    4436 and I'll be okay
    4686 
    4775 Ya, I'm not big on
    4992 social graces
    5115 think I'll slip on down
    5274 to the oasis
    5448 So I've got friends
    5721 in low places
    6862 
    7462 Well I guess I was wrong
    7636 I just don't belong
    7797 but then, ha
    7899 I've been there before
    8124 everything's all right
    8315 I'll just say goodnight
    8434 and I'll show myself to the door
    8731 
    8812 Hey, I didn't mean
    8986 to cause a big scene
    9151 Just give me an hour
    9314 and then
    9486 Well I'll be as high
    9618 as that ivory tower
    9908 that you're livin' in
   10131 
   10163 Cause I've got friends
   10306 in low places
   10471 where the whiskey drowns
   10649 and the beer
   10733 chases my blues away
   11112 and I'll be okay
   11439 Ya, I'm not big on
   11666 social graces
   11788 think I'll slip on down
   11954 to the oasis

   12387 in low places
   12784 
   12815 I've got friends
   12949 in low places
   13105 where the whiskey drowns
   13275 and the beer
   13368 chases my blues away
   13743 and I'll be okay
   14127 Ya I'm not big on
   14295 social graces
   14419 think I'll slip on down

@SONG: Callin' Baton Rouge
     762 I spent last night in the arms
     901 of a girl from Louisianna
    1106 Though I'm out on the highway
    1225 my thoughts are still with her
    1435 Such a strange combination
    1565 of a woman and a child
    1779 Such a strange situation
    1903 stoppin' ev'ry hundred miles
    2033 callin' Baton Rouge
    2649 
    2792 A replay of last nights events roll through my mind
    3122 except a scene or two
    3260 erased by sweet red wine
    3465 And I see a truck-stop sign ahead so I change lanes
    3793 I need a cup of coffee
    3929 and a couple dollars change
    4058 callin' Baton Rouge
    4384 
    4451 Operator, won't you put me on through
    4601 I've gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
    4783 Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
    4933 I've got to talk to the girl just'a one more time
    6317 
    6472 Hello Sammantha dear
    6593 I hope you're feeling fine
    6804 And it won't be long
    6896 until I'm with you all the time
    7070 But until then I'll spend my money
    7252 up right down to my last dime
    7489 Callin Baton Rouge
    8018 
    8367 Operator, won't you put me on through
    8543 I've gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
    8718 Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
    8875 I've got to talk to the girl just'a one more time
    9338 Callin Baton Rouge
    9828 Sweet Baton Rouge
   10162 My Baton Rouge

@SONG: The River
    3635 You know a dream is like a river
    3881 Ever changin' as it flows
    4119 And a dreamer's just a vessel
    4325 That must follow where it goes
    4535 Trying to learn from what's behind you
    4816 And never knowing what's in store
    5015 Makes each day a constant battle
    5302 Just to stay between the shores
    5608 
    5617 And, I will sail my vessel
    5902 'Til the river runs dry
    6142 Like a bird upon the wind
    6375 These waters are my sky
    6562 I'll never reach my destination
    6883 If I never try
    7052 So I will sail my vessel
    7330 'Til the river runs dry
    7789 
    7864 Too many times we stand aside
    8152 And let the waters slip away
    8369 'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
    8633 Has now become today
    8824 So don't you sit upon the shoreline
    9105 And say you're satisfied
    9361 Choose to chance the rapids
    9589 And dare to dance the tide
    9786 
    9898 Yes, I will sail my vessel
   10183 'Til the river runs dry
   10422 Like a bird upon the wind
   10658 These waters are my sky
   10832 I'll never reach my destination
   11166 If I never try
   11327 So I will sail my vessel
   11610 'Til the river runs dry
   11829 
   11942 And there's bound to be rough waters
   12200 And I know I'll take some falls
   12414 But with the good Lord as my captain
   12676 I can make it through them all
   12929 
   12987 Yes, I will sail my vessel
   13265 'Til the river runs dry
   13504 Like a bird upon the wind
   13740 These waters are my sky
   13920 I'll never reach my destination
   14245 If I never try
   14408 So I will sail my vessel
   14687 'Til the river runs dry
   14897 
   15006 Yes, I will sail my vessel
   15284 'Til the river runs dry
   15751 'Til the river runs dry

@SONG: Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)
    1874 This ol' highway's getting longer
    2293 Seems there ain't no end in sight
    2733 To sleep would be best
    2902 but I just can't afford to rest
    3174 I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night
    3444 
    3646 I called the house but no one answered
    4075 For the last two weeks no one's been home
    4515 I guess she's through with me
    4680 to tell the truth I just can't see
    4912 What's kept the woman holding on this long
    5200 
    5330 And the white line's getting longer
    5590 and the saddle's getting cold
    5802 I'm much too young to feel this damn old
    6225 All my cards are on the table
    6446 with no ace left in the hole
    6692 I'm much too young to feel this damn old
    7914 
    8985 The competition's getting younger
    9344 Tougher broncs
    9463 you know I can't recall
    9760 The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux
   10007 lonely women and bad booze
   10229 Seem to be the only friends I've left at all
   10537 
   10647 And the white line's getting longer
   10896 and the saddle's getting cold
   11103 I'm much too young to feel this damn old
   11530 All my cards are on the table
   11751 with no ace left in the hole
   11992 I'm much too young to feel this damn old
   12281 
   12413 Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old

@SONG: The Thunder Rolls
    1342 Three-thirty in the mornin'
    1559 not a soul in sight
    1767 The city's lookin' like a ghost town
    1962 on a moonless summer night
    2117 
    2209 Rain drops on the windshield
    2369 There's a storm movin' in
    2636 He's headin' back from somewhere
    2806 that he never should have been
    3042 
    3092 And the thunder rolls
    3517 And the thunder rolls
    3976 
    4064 Every light is burnin'
    4236 in a house across town
    4484 She's pacin' by the telephone
    4671 in her faded flannel gown
    4884 
    4934 Askin' for a miracle
    5128 Hopin' she's not right
    5368 Prayin' it's the weather
    5543 that's kept him out all night
    5718 
    5810 And the thunder rolls
    6251 And the thunder rolls
    6410 
    6485 The thunder rolls
    6685 and the lightnin' strikes
    6911 Another love grows cold
    7118 on a sleepless night
    7352 As the storm blows on
    7580 out of control
    7794 Deep in her heart
    8028 the thunder rolls
    8486 
    8994 She's waitin' by the window
    9169 when he pulls into the drive
    9428 She rushes out to hold him
    9628 thankful he's alive
    9878 But on the wind and rain
   10054 a strange new perfume blows
   10261 And the lightning flashes in her eyes
   10498 And he knows that she knows
   10669 
   10754 And the thunder rolls
   11203 And the thunder rolls
   11311 
   11650 The thunder rolls
   11845 and the lightnin' strikes
   12063 Another love grows cold
   12278 on a sleepless night
   12503 As the storm blows on
   12743 out of control
   12960 Deep in her heart
   13187 the thunder rolls

@SONG: If Tommorow Never Comes
     369 Sometimes late at night
     748 I lay awake
     884 and watch her sleeping
    1374 She's lost in peaceful dreams
    1553 so I turn out the lights
    1737 and lay there in the dark
    2101 
    2190 And a thought crosses my mind
    2594 If I never wake up
    2767 in the morning
    3254 would she ever doubt
    3472 the way I feel about her
    3662 in my heart
    3954 
    4024 If tomorrow never comes
    4494 will she know how much
    4629 I loved her
    4962 Did I try in every way
    5222 to show her every day
    5431 that she's my only one
    5816 
    5858 And if my time on earth
    6050 were through
    6303 and she must face this world
    6516 without me
    6745 is the love I gave her
    6887 in the past
    7032 gonna be enough to last
    7271 if tomorrow never comes
    7661 
    7707 'Cause I've lost loved ones
    7838 in my life
    8136 who never knew how much
    8318 I loved them
    8774 Now I live with the regret
    8922 that my true feelings for them
    9144 never were revealed
    9500 
    9505 So I made a promise to myself
    9987 to say each day
   10117 how much she means
   10271 to me
   10616 and avoid that circumstance
   10786 where there's no second chance
   10973 to tell her how I feel
   11329 
   11372 'Cause if tomorrow never comes
   11871 will she know how much
   12002 I loved her
   12331 did I try in every way
   12568 to show her every day
   12797 that she's my only one
   13117 
   13206 And if my time on earth
   13406 were through
   13656 and she must face this world
   13866 without me
   14111 is the love I gave her
   14245 in the past
   14400 gonna be enough to last
   14628 if tomorrow never comes
   15017 
   15044 So tell that someone that you love
   15327 just what you're thinkin' of
   15560 if tomorrow never comes

@SONG: Unanswered Prayers
     659 Just the other night
     869 at a hometown football game
    1120 my wife and I ran into
    1389 my old highschool flame
    1603 And as I introduced them
    1859 the past came back to me
    2084 and I couldn't help
    2212 but think of
    2342 the way things used to be
    2654 
    2759 She was the one
    2941 that I'd wanted for all times
    3205 and each night I'd spend prayin'
    3428 that God would make her mine
    3690 And if he'd only grant me
    3923 this wish I wished back then
    4152 I'd never ask for anything again
    4485 
    4758 Sometimes I thank God
    5139 for unanswered prayers

    5628 to the man upstairs
    5801 And just because
    5935 he doesn't answer
    6121 doesn't mean he don't care

    6817 are unanswered prayers

    7599 She wasn't quite the angel
    7819 that I'd remembered in my dreams
    8070 And I can tell that
    8143 time had changed me
    8320 in her eyes too it seemed
    8553 We tried to talk about
    8679 the old days
    8784 There wasn't much
    8875 we could recall
    9038 I guess the Lord knows
    9160 what he's doin'
    9260 after all
    9504 
    9801 And as she walked away
   10012 well I looked at my wife
   10266 And then and there
   10345 I thanked the good Lord
   10512 for the gifts in my life
   10956 
   10990 Sometimes I thank God
   11363 for unanswered prayers

   11848 to the man upstairs
   12046 And just because
   12157 he may not answer
   12341 doesn't mean
   12409 he don't care
   12705 'Cause some of God's greatest gifts
   13044 are unanswered...
   13202 Some of God's greatest gifts
   13439 are all too often unanswered

   13685 Some of God's greatest gifts
   14004 are unanswered prayers

@SONG: Standing Outside The Fire
     612 We call them cool
     759 Those hearts that
     831 have no scars
     947 to show
    1079 The ones that
    1145 never do let go
    1391 and risk the tables
    1517 bein' turned
    1518 
    1864 We call them fools
    2032 Who have to dance
    2123 within the flame
    2344 Who chances sorrow
    2462 and the shame
    2655 that always comes
    2752 with getting burned
    2753 
    3142 But you got to be tough

    3669

    6133 the slightest chance
    6233 love might exist
    6450 and for that
    6539 forsake it all

    9410 that is burning
    9530 deep in my soul
    9683 Constantly yearning
    9808 to get out of control
   10002 Wanting to climb
   10163 higher and higher

    1620 Just to change the way he feels
    1954 She knows his love's in Tulsa
    2134 And she knows he's gonna go
    2463 Well, it ain't no woman, flesh and blood
    2663 It's that damned old rodeo
    2744 
    2866 Well, it's bulls and blood
    2984 It's dust and mud
    3088 It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
    3293 It's the white in his knuckles
    3412 The gold in the buckle
    3496 He'll win the next go 'round
    3698 It's boots and chaps
    3808 It's cowboy hats
    3914 It's spurs and latigo
    4105 It's the ropes and the reins
    4216 And the joy and the pain
    4313 And they call the thing rodeo
    5151 
    5244 She does her best to hold him
    5466 When his love comes to call
    5756 But his need for it controls him

    9773 It'll drive the man insane
   10070 And he'll sell off everything he owns
   10288 Just to pay to play her game
   10588 And a broken home and some broken bones
   10798 Is all he'll have to show

@SONG: What She's Doing Now

    1191 turnin' colder
    1393 But that was years ago
    1824 Last I heard she had
    2051 moved to Boulder
    2243 But where she's now
    2373 I don't know
    2692 But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
    3131 that spins my head around
    3590 Takes me back
    3790 and makes me wonder
    4040 What she's doin' now
    4128 
    4299 'Cause what she's doin' now
    4493 is tearin' me apart
    4754 Fillin' up my mind
    4940 and emptyin' my heart
    5195 I can hear her call
    5377 each time the cold wind blows
    5591 And I wonder if she knows
    6068 what she's doin' now
    6562 
    7082 Just for laughs
    7252 I dialed her old number
    7538 But no one knew her name
    7958 Hung up the phone
    8181 sat there and wondered
    8339 If she'd ever done the same
    8847 I took a walk in the evenin' wind
    9284 to clear my head somehow
    9724 But tonight
    9925 I lie here thinkin'
   10178 Whats she doin' now
   10318 
   10439 'Cause what she's doin' now
   10632 is tearin' me apart
   10887 Fillin' up my mind
   11089 and emptyin' my heart
   11325 I can hear her call

@SONG: Papa Loved Mama
     892 Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
    1085 You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife
    1335 The part she couldn't handle was the being alone
    1521 I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
    1769 Papa called Mama each and every night
    1958 Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
    2205 Mama would wait for that call to come in
    2391 When Daddy'd hang up she was gone again
    2597 
    2796 Mama was a looker
    2905 Lord, how she shined
    3008 Papa was a good'n
    3100 But the jealous kind
    3234 Papa loved Mama
    3341 Mama loved men
    3615 Mama's in the graveyard
    3725 Papa's in the pen
    3948 
    4209 Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
    4416 Papa came home and it was just us kids
    4650 He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
    4842 If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine
    5077 I heard him cry for Mama up and own the hall
    5276 Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
    5507 That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
    5722 When Papa fired it up and headed into town
    5994 
    6110 Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
    6334 Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
    6559 The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
    6911 He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears
    7195 
    7325 Mama was a looker
    7434 Lord, how she shined
    7545 Papa was a good'n
    7630 But the jealous kind

@SONG: That Summer
     850 I went to work for her that summer
    1166 A teenage kid so far from home
    1500 She was a lonely widowed woman
    1812 Hell-bent to make it on her own
    2142 We were a thousand miles from no-where
    2454 Wheat fields as far as I could see
    2774 Both needing something from each other
    3112 Not knowing yet what that might be
    3381 
    3424 'Till she came to me one evening
    3745 Hot cup of coffee and a smile
    4094 In a dress that I was certain
    4386 she hadn't worn in quite a while
    4698 There was a difference in her laughter
    5010 There was a softness in her eye
    5331 And on the air there was a hunger
    5652 even a boy could recognize
    5938 
    5964 She had a need to feel the thunder
    6285 To chase the lightning from the sky
    6605 To watch a storm with all it's wonder
    6917 raging in her lover's eye
    7238 She had to ride the heat of passion
    7567 Like a comet burning bright
    7890 Rushin' along in the wind
    8027 Out where only dreams had been
    8210 Burning both ends of the night

    8824 Nothin' between us but the night
    9145 And when I told her that I'd never
    9465 She softly whispered
    9552 "that's all right"
    9786 And I watched her hands of leather
   10124 turn to velvet in a touch
   10427 There's never been another summer
   10748 when I have ever learned so much
   10999 
   11060 We had a need to feel the thunder
   11372 To chase the lightning from the sky
   11693 To watch a storm with all it's wonder
   12023 raging in each other's eye
   12325 We had to ride the heat of passion
   12655 like a comet burning bright
   12979 Rushin' along in the wind
   13115 Out where only dreams had been
   13279 Burning both ends of the night
   13556 
   14544 Often think about that summer
   14848 The sweat, the moonlight, and the lace
   15168 And I have rarely held another
   15498 when I haven't seen her face
   15810 And every time I pass a wheat field
   16122 And watch it dancin' with the wind
   16442 Although I know it isn't real
   16624 I just can't help but feel
   16764 her hungry arms again
   16962 
   17066 She had a need to feel the thunder
   17378 To chase the lightning from the sky
   17690 To watch a storm with all it's wonder
   18020 raging in her lover's eye
   18314 She had to ride the heat of passion
   18644 Like a comet burning bright
   18950 Rushin' along in the wind
   19095 Out where only dreams had been
   19269 Burning both ends of the night
   19537 
   19589 Rushin' along in the wind
   19719 Out where only dreams had been
   19892 Burning both ends of the night

@SONG: The Dance
    1336 Looking back
    1588 on the memory of
    1898 The dance we shared
    2138 'neath the stars above
    2423 For a moment
    2682 all the world was right
    2943 How could I have known
    3228 that you'd ever say goodbye
    3412 
    3513 And now
    3664 I'm glad I didn't know
    3956 The way it all would end
    4204 The way it all would go
    4579 Our lives
    4749 are better left to chance
    5018 I could have missed the pain
    5281 But I'd of had to miss
    5565 the dance
    5864 
    6174 Holding you
    6440 I held everything
    6706 For a moment
    6975 wasn't I a king
    7224 But if I'd only known
    7503 how the king would fall
    7794 Hey who's to say
    8039 you know I might have changed it all
    8244 
    8323 And now
    8486 I'm glad I didn't know
    8767 The way it all would end
    9024 The way it all would go
    9389 Our lives
    9557 are better left to chance
    9826 I could have missed the pain
   10080 But I'd of had to miss
   10382 the dance
   10685 
   10680 Yes my life
   10891 It's better left to chance
   11146 I could have missed the pain
   11422 but I'd of had to miss
   11706 the dance
