Somewhere tonite
we come alive
Two hearts ignite
we're one of a kind
Here we are
undivided by
anything
Just you and I
We've come so far
no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?

We stick together
we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
we do it in Unison

????ome together
and stronger we are
Just when the world can tear us apart
We go on as one
we do it in Unison

Gleam of an eye,
flash of a smile
Never too shy
playin' ever so wild
Here we are
I'm relying on
no one else
But you and I
we've come so far
No one else could ever
steal away what we confide
who wants to know?

We stick together
we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
we do it in Unison

We come together
and stronger we are
Just when the world can
can tear us apart
We go on as one
we do it in Unison

?Rockin' as one there's no time to stop
?I know what we've got
?we do it in Unison

stay together
you and me

Here we are undivided by anything
Just you and I
We've come so far
no one else could ever
Steal away what we confide
Who wants to know?

We stick together
we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
we do it in Unison

We come together
and stronger we are
Just when the world can
can tear us apart
We go on as one
we do it in Unison

We stick together
we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
we do it do it do it in Unison

We come together
and stronger we are
Just when the world can
can tear us apart
We go on as one
we do it in Unison

We stick together
we're never apart
Everybody knows who we are
Because we are one
