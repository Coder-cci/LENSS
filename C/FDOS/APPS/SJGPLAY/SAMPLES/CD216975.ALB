@SONG: Sitting inside my head
      26 I walk around this town
     164 as buildings close
     263 and windows are boarded
     549 I think about you
     793 When I hear a door slam in the wind
     982 and glass on the mat says welcome
    1313 I think about you.
    1586 Sitting inside my head
    1753 Laughing at what I said,
    1955 Come on baby lets have another toast
    2348 You might thing I'm dense
    2529 laughing at my expence
    2700 Lets fill the cup
    2800 lets wash away the ghost
    3200 .
    3848 In this ghost town where we live
    4002 there's a wanted poster
    4079 of you on every corner
    4232 She keeps asking me whos that
    4375 and whats her name?
    4601 But I choke on every letter,
    4806 as the glass flies off the table,
    4992 I keep telling her
    5081 I aint the one to blame.
    5407 Sitting inside my head
    5589 Laughing at what I said,
    5782 Come on baby lets have another toast
    6172 You might thing I'm dense
    6346 laughing at my expence
    6521 Lets fill the cup
    6631 lets wash away the ghost.
    6905 I left when I was gone
    7117 I didn't feel a thing
    7304 I never dreamt youd haunt me
    7451 this long after
    7666 But the buildings crumble down,
    7905 as I ran from the town
    8059 I hear you breath
    8140 and I listen to you laughter.
    8500 .
    9993 Sitting inside my head
   10171 Laughing at what I said,
   10372 Come on baby lets have another toast
   10756 You might thing Im dense
   10939 laughing at my expence
   11110 Lets fill the cup
   11209 lets wash away the ghost.
   11495 I walk around this town
   11629 as buildings close
   11727 and windows are boarded
   12007 I think about you
   12249 When I hear a door slam in the wind
   12445 and glass on the mat says welcome
   12783 I think about you.
   12935 I think about you.
   13165 I'm thinking about you.
   13935 I'm thinking about you.

@SONG: Freak me
      45 If I met you,
     506 I'd probably hate you,
     945 But I never got to,
    1431 So I love you,
    1877 So I,
    1997 Love,
    2110 Hate you.
    2212 Starting a hole in me
    2289 like I'm see through
    2436 You vex me,
    2541 Im fumbling,
    2617 every time I turn around
    2711 you're there.
    2979 YOU FREAK ME
    3248 .
    3887 YOU FREAK ME
    4113 .
    4937 Hey. You looking at me?
    5432 Was I looking at you?
    5894 Butterflies in my pants.
    6343 Got ants in my heart.
    6829 I could,
    6943 talk to you,
    7051 Walk away
    7171 Try to pretend I'm unaffected but,
    7365 Who started this.
    7499 Wasn't me.
    7556 Speak now or forever hold your peace.

   12004 You want a love fight
   12123 You want to slice up my jimmy
   12240 like a jack knife
   12360 YOU FREAK ME

    1277 Outside is a storm
    1632 Inside is nothing
    1955 Just me and my head
    2267 on a pillow with no stuffing
    2634 Im trying to sleep
    2991 Trying to rest
    3324 Trying to forget
    3616 about this hole in my chest
    3797 But the thunder groans
    3964 and the rain it hollers
    4136 and the hole gets bigger
    4333 and I get smaller
    4478 and the hole gets bigger
    4667 and starts to grow teeth
    4819 and I start to give up
    4988 on the idea of sleep
    5285 And so I ask again
    5795 Where you crying
    6003 or was it just the rain
    6533 The rain that rains in my bucket
    6871 The rain that rains in my heart
    7214 the rain that rained
    7382 and kept on raining
    7550 The rain that rained from the start
    8087 Outside its raging
    8424 Inside it is too
    8746 It beats on the door
    9060 but I wont let it through
    9422 My hands are full
    9788 My hands are tied
   10102 My body it shakes
   10416 When I think how hard I tried
   10609 But the rain it crushes
   10782 and mangles the tin
   10928 And the rain still trying
   11119 to find a way in
   11272 And up from the hole
   11436 in my chest comes a head
   11611 And I can't begin
   11777 to repeat what it said
   12072 And so I ask again
   12588 Where you crying
   12796 or was it just the rain
   13327 The rain that rains in my bucket
   13663 The rain that rains in my heart
   14007 the rain that rained
   14176 and kept on raining
   14346 The rain that rained from the start
   14686 The rain that pours down like lemonade
   15023 It starts of sweet
   15154 and then goes flat
   15363 The rain that rains
   15524 on my parade
   15701 The rain that keeps coming back
   16200 .
   17565 The rain comes down
   17936 It doesn't stop
   18255 The bucket it nearly
   18613 filled to the top
   18745 But the drips drop in
   18934 in single file
   19083 and I even start
   19255 to forget for a while
   19421 and the head fall back
   19592 and the teeth start to grin
   19763 as the hole closes
   19931 and stretch my skin
   20227 I go to the window
   20916 I look out the pain
   21588 I don't see your tears
   22346 Only the rain
   22906 .
   24193 The rain that rains in my bucket
   24534 The rain that rains in my heart
   24873 the rain that rained
   25041 and kept on raining
   25197 The rain that rained from the start
   25555 The rain that rains in my bucket
   25891 The rain that rains in my heart
   26236 the rain that rained
   26406 and kept on raining
   26574 The rain that rained from the start
   27200 .
