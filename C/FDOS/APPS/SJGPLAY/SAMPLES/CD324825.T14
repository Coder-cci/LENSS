    1425 On the street where you live
    1566 girls talk about their social lives.
    1834 They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint,
    2050 a touch of sable in their eyes.
    2342 ALL YOUR LIFE
    2389 All your life all you've asked when's your Daddy gonna talk to you.
    2797 You were living in another world
    2989 tryin' to get a message through.
    3236 
    3322 No one heard a single word you said.
    3734 They should have seen it in your eyes
    3973 what was going around your head
    4181 
    4348 Ooh, she's a little runaway.

    5715 A different line every night
    5850 guaranteed to blow your mind.

    6646 So you sit home alone
    6779 'cause there's nothing left that you can do.
    7045 There's only pictures hung in the shadows
    7249 left there to look at you.
    7457 
    7578 You know she likes the lights at nights
    7759 on the neon Broadway signs
