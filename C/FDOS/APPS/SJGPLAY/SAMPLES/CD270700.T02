    1099 As she pours herself another cup of coffee
    1649 As she contemplates the stain across the wall
    2192 And it's in between the cleaning and the washing
    2740 That's when looking back's
    2894 the hardest part of all
    3176 
    3284 And she always did her best
    3493 to try and please him
    3824 While he always did his best
    4052 to make her cry
    4376 And she got down on her knees
    4596 to stop him leaving
    4921 But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye

    5550 Where are your friends?
    5686 Where are your children?
    6094 Is this your house?
    6235 Is this your home?
    6638 Does nothing ever last forever?
    7186 Does everybody sleep alone?
    7674 Alone
    7927 
    8196 And he tears the business tags from his old suitcase
    8739 As he packs away the pieces of his life
    9285 They all love him
    9418 but they always try to change him
    9832 That's what happens when a girl becomes a wife
   10266 
   10376 As she pours herself another cup of coffee
   10922 As the pictures leave a clean space on the wall
   11467 And it's in between the leaving and the loving
   12009 That's when looking back's
   12173 the hardest part of all
   12396 
   12641 Where are your friends?
   12780 Where are your children?
