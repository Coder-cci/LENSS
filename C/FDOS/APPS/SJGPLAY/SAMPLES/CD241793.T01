    1366 They'll be no strings to bind your hands
    1665 not if my love can't bind your heart
    2348 there's no need to take a stand
    2647 for it was I who chose to stop

    4292 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
    4767 Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
    5221 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
    5748 Then slowly turn away

    6970 then it won't matter anyhow
    7642 If morning's echo says we sinned
    7943 well it was what I wanted now

    9532 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
    9996 Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
   10466 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
   10988 Then slowly turn away
   11339 I won't beg you to stay
   11851 With me
   11984 
   12377 with my tears
   12821 always
   13289 always
   13356 
   13538 Baby....
   13797 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
   14262 Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
   14706 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
   15194 Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
   15647 Just call me angel of the morning, angel
   16118 Just touch my cheek before you leave me, darling
