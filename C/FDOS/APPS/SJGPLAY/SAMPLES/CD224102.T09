     206 This ain't no disco
     469 it ain't no country club either
     803 This is L.A.
     971 
    1011 "All I want to do
    1092 is have a little fun
    1172 before I die"
    1274 says the man next to me
    1382 out of nowhere
    1628 apropos of nothin'
    1752 He says his name is William
    1902 but I'm sure he's Bill or Billy
    2056 or Mac or Buddy
    2187 and he's plain ugly to me
    2393 and I wonder if he's
    2493 ever had a day of fun
    2593 in his whole life
    2846 
    2846 And we are drinking beer
    2960 at noon on tuesday
    3078 In the bar that faces
    3212 a giant car-wash
    3398 And the good people of the world
    3524 are washing their cars
    3632 on their lunch-break
    3737 hosin' and scrubbin'
    3824 as best they can
    3898 in skirts and suits
    4021 
    4077 They drive their shiny
    4185 Datsuns and Buicks
    4371 Back to the phone company
    4482 the record store too
    4670 Well, they're nothing like
    4746 Billy and me
    4790 
    4820 'cause, all I want to do
    4973 is have some fun
    5134 I got a feelin'
    5284 I'm not the only one
    5430 all I wanna do
    5569 is have some fun
    5731 I got a feelin'
    5875 I'm not the only one
    6032 all I wanna do
    6167 is have some fun
    6332 until the sun comes up
    6518 over Santa Monica Boulevard
    7303 
    7328 I like a good beer buzz
    7449 early in the morning
    7583 And Billy likes to peel the labels
    7726 from his bottles of Bud
    7904 he shreds them on the bar
    8023 then he lights every match
    8130 in an oversized pack
    8267 lettin' each one burn
    8455 down to his
    8565 thick fingers before
    8686 blowin' and cursin' them out
    8852 and he's watching the bottles of Bud
    8972 as they spin on the floor
    9166 And a happy couple
    9249 enters the bar
    9450 dangerously close to one another
    9726 The bartender looks up from his want-ads
    9868 
    9907 But all I wanna do
   10066 is have some fun
   10229 I got a feelin'
   10379 I'm not the only one
   10526 all I wanna do
   10656 is have some fun
   10826 I got a feelin'
   10978 I'm not the only one
   11126 all I wanna do
   11262 is have some fun
   11425 until the sun comes up
   11616 over Santa Monica Boulevard
   12991 
   13068 Otherwise, the bar is ours
   13336 the day and the night
   13439 and the car-wash too
   13646 the matches and the Buds
   13758 and the clean and dirty cars
   13959 the sun and the moon
   14064 
   14109 But all I wanna do
   14259 is have some fun
   14426 I got a feelin'
   14576 I'm not the only one
   14728 all I wanna do
   14860 is have some fun
   15023 I got a feelin'
   15176 I'm not the only one
   15323 all I wanna do
   15462 is have some fun
   15622 I got a feelin'
   15760 the party has just begun
   15880 
   15924 all I wanna do
   16058 is have some fun
   16222 I won't tell ya
   16358 that you're the only one
   16523 all I wanna do
   16659 is have some fun
   16824 until the sun comes up
   17012 over Santa Monica Boulevard
   17378 
   17420 until the sun comes up
   17611 over Santa Monica Boulevard
