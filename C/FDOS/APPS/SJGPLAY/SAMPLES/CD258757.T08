      75 I had no choice but to hear you
     523 You stated your case time and again
     979 I thought about it
     974 
    1414 You treat me like I'm a princess
    1873 I'm not used to liking that
    2310 You ask how my day was
    2320 
    2635 You've already won me over in spite of me
    3098 Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
    3545 Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
    4052 I couldn't help it
    4254 It's all your fault
    4069 
    4553 Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
    5011 You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
    5444 That's not lip service
    5464 
    5782 You've already won me over in spite of me
    6243 Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
    6685 Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
    7193 I couldn't help it
    7411 It's all your fault
    7416 
    7702 You are the bearer of unconditional things
    8146 You held your breath and the door for me
    8593 Thanks for your patience
    8593 
   10837 You're the best listener that I've ever met
   11286 You're my best friend
   11539 Best friend with benefits
   11742 What took me so long
   11742 
   12189 I've never felt this healthy before
   12639 I've never wanted something rational
   13089 I am aware now
   13531 I am aware now
   13531 
   13859 You've already won me over in spite of me
   14311 Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
   14763 Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
   15266 I couldn't help it
   15492 It's all your fault
