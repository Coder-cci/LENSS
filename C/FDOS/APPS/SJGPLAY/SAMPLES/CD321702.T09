    1050 Imagine there's no heaven
    1518 It's easy if you try
    2004 No hell below us
    2538 Above us only sky
    2958 Imagine all the people
    3381 Livin' for today...
    3738 a ah
    3867 
    3957 Imagine there's no countries
    4392 It isn't hard to do
    4884 Nothing to kill or die for
    5370 And no religion, too
    5811 Imagine all the people
    6243 Livin' life in peace...
    6594 you...
    6813 You may say I'm a dreamer
    7284 But I'm not the only one
    7740 I hope some day you'll join us
    8232 And the world will be as one
    8553 
    8676 Imagine no possessions
    9141 I wonder if you can
    9612 No need for greed or hunger
   10104 A brotherhood of man
   10548 Imagine all the people
   10983 Sharing all the world
   11337 you...
   11547 You may say I'm a dreamer
   12024 But I'm not the only one
   12465 I hope some day you'll join us
   12987 And the world will live as one
