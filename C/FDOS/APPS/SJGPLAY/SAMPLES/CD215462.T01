    1851 I'm dancing in the shadows of life
    2144 and death is all around me tonight
    2421 I miss you making love to me right
    2706 Beside myself I'm holding you tight
    2999 Someone is waiting for me to
    3253 rise and dive into the ocean
    3506 I cried and I cried and I cried
    3718 my baby to sleep
    3867 beside myself my soul will keep
    4140 
    4185 right beside you
    4363 I see
    4478 right beside you
    4657 I stay
    4763 right beside you
    4945 I'll be
    5053 right beside you
    5237 always
    5839 
    5888 We're dancing in the shade
    6098 of the summer sun
    6232 the drums are playing
    6404 the change to come
    6524 was yesterday
    6665 in the heat beside myself
    6881 I need to keep
    7037 
    7066 right beside you
    7250 I feel
    7355 right beside you
    7539 I am
    7641 right beside you
    7829 I kneel
    7931 right beside you
    8118 I stand
    8223 right beside you
    8402 I see
    8504 right beside you
    8688 I stay
    8793 right beside you
    8976 I'll be
    9081 right beside you
    9251 always
    9251 
    9295 Driving into town with the top down
    9421 sun sinking low into the water
    9508 I can feel your speed
    9594 One hand on the wheel
    9659 one hand on my knee
    9733 I can tell you what I want
    9809 you can tell me what you need
    9915 darling nights are getting cooler
    9986 and the city's so close
   10060 there's a place we can do it
   10120 somewhere right along the coast
   10210 we'll arrive on time
   10277 just a little bit late
   10334 it's not a matter of style
   10418 just a lesson in taste
   10507 
   10523 I remember when I was your child
   10705 you made me up to be your lover
   10857 now I'm sitting right beside you
   11006 other people still exist
   11137 I don't pretend to love them less
   11281 but darling
   11348 when you drive this way I lose my breath
   11637 
   11821 right beside you
   12000 I feel
   12106 right beside you
   12286 I am
   12394 right beside you
   12575 I kneel
   12681 right beside you
   12866 I stand
   12968 right beside you
   13150 I see
   13257 right beside you
   13438 I stay
   13542 right beside you
   13732 I'll be
   13832 right beside you
   14443 always
   14524 
   14557 right beside you
   14740 I feel
   14837 right beside you
   15024 I am
   15135 right beside you
   15310 I kneel
   15414 right beside you
   15604 I stand
   15707 right beside you
   15886 I see
   15995 right beside you
   16179 I stay
   16287 right beside you
   16464 I'll be
   16569 right beside you
   16749 always
