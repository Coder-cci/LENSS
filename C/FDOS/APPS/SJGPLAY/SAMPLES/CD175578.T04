    1004 There is freedom within
    1228 There is freedom without
    1400 Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
    1894 There's a battle ahead
    2118 many battles are lost
    2288 But you'll never see the end of the road
    2442 while you're travelling with me
    2618 
    2729 Hey, now
    2786 Hey, now
    2898 Don't dream it's over
    3142 Hey, now
    3232 Hey, now
    3344 When the world comes in
    3581 They come
    3678 they come
    3833 To build a wall between us
    4061 We know they won't win
    4419 
    4559 Now I'm towing my car
    4782 there's a hole in the roof
    4942 My possessions are causing me suspicion
    5114 but there's no proof
    5275 
    5443 In the paper today
    5666 tales of war and of waste
    5841 But you turn right over to the TV page
    6166

    6451 Don't dream it's over
    6706 Hey, now
    6784 Hey, now
    6897 When the world comes in
    7118 They come
    7228 they come
    7386 To build a wall between us
    7616 We know they won't win
   10622 
   10862 Now I'm walking again
   11085 to the beat of a drum
   11245 And I'm counting the steps to the door
   11403 of your heart
   11576 
   11742 Only shadows ahead
   11959 barely clearing the roof
   12127 Get to know the feeling
   12235 of liberation and release
   12453 
   12527 Hey, now

   13176 When the world comes in
   13395 They come
   13501 they come
   13654 To build a wall between us
   13878 We know they won't win
   14456
