    3966 There's a lady who's sure
    4249 all that glitters is gold
    4468 And she's buying a stairway
    4749 to heaven
    4967 When she gets there she knows
    5226 if the stores are all closed
    5460 with a word she can get
    5699 what she came for
    5990 
    6066 oohhh
    6318 
    6454 And she's buying a stairway
    6758 to heaven
    6964 
    6965 There's a sign on the wall
    7237 but she wants to be sure
    7456 Cause you know sometimes words have
    7747 two meanings
    7904 
    7995 In a tree by the brook
    8256 there's a songbird who sings
    8475 Sometimes all of our thoughts
    8722 are misgiven
    8999 
   10325 Ooo, it makes me wonder
   11013 Ooo, it makes me wonder
   11721 
   11871 There's a feeling I get
   12112 when I look to the west
   12313 and my spirit is crying
   12545 for leaving
   12773 In my thoughts I have seen
   13009 rings of smoke through the trees
   13230 and the voices of those
   13445 who stand looking
   13755 
   14144 Ooo, it makes me wonder
   14869 Ooo, it really makes me wonder
   15421 
   15672 And it's whispered that soon
   15894 if we all call the tune
   16112 then the piper will lead us
   16327 to reason
   16563 And a new day will dawn
   16801 for those who stand long
   16989 And the forest will echo
   17210 with laughter
   17674 
   18781 oh wow oh
   19173 
   19455 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
   19716 don't be alarmed now
   19885 It's just a spring clean for the May-queen
   20308 Yes there are two paths you can go by
   20567 but in the long run
   20738 And there's still time to change the road you're on
   21338 
   21667 And it makes me wonder
   22371 aahh ow oh
   22751 
   23011 Your head is humming and it won't go
   23263 in case you don't know
   23432 The piper's calling you to join him
   23852 Dear lady can you hear the wind blow
   24117 and did you know
   24273 Your stairway lies on the wispering wind
   26783 
   30274 And as we wind on down the road
   30626 our shadows taller than our soul
   30981 there walks a lady we all know
   31322 who shines white light and wants to show
   31679 how everything still turns to gold
   32033 and if you listen very hard
   32380 the tune will come to you at last
   32712 When all are one and one is all, yeah
   33076 To be a rock
   33190 and not to roll
   34649 
   34879 And she's buying
   35220 a stairway
   35530 to heaven
