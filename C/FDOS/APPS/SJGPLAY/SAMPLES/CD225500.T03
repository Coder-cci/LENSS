1675     Today is gonna be the day
1824     That they're gonna throw it back to you
2090     By now you should've somehow
2240     Realised what you gotta do
2475     I don't believe that anybody
2684     Feels the way I do
2828     about you now.
2961
3328     Backbeat the word is on the street
3489     That the fire in your heart is out
3747     I'm sure you've heard it all before
3896     But you never really had a doubt
4133     I don't believe that anybody feels
4380     The way I do about you now.
4627
4942     And all the roads we have to walk are winding
5354     And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
5798     There are many things that I would
5994     Like to say to you
6122     But I don't know how
6308
6575     Because maybe
6902     You're gonna be the one that saves me?
7324     And after all
7702     You're my wonderwall...
8065
8604     Today was gonna be the day?
8762     But they'll never throw it back to you
9024     By now you should've somehow
9180     Realised what you're not to do
9409     I don't believe that anybody
9600     Feels the way I do
9762     About you now.
9885
10211    And all the roads that lead you there are winding
10630    And all the lights that light the way are blinding
11065    There are many things that I would like to say to you
11399    But I don't know how
11575
11857    I said maybe
12168    You're gonna be the one that saves me?
12590    And after all
12965    You're my wonderwall.
13347
13509    I said maybe
13820    Your gonna be the one that saves me?
14243    And after all
14640    Your my wonderwall.
14950
15158    I said maybe
15481    Your gonna be the one that saves me
15750
15898    Your gonna be the one that saves me
16236
16317    Your gonna be the one that saves me....
