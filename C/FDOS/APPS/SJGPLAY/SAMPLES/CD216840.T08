; TITLE: You Win My Love
; CD   : Shania Twain - The Women In Me
; ------
I'm lookin' for a lover
who can rev his little engine up
He can have a '55 chevy
Or a fancy little pick-up truck
If he's got a cool Cadillac
With a jacuzzi in the back I'm in,
Oh yeah

'cause I'm a classy little chassis
Who's a-huntin' for a heart to win

Oh, but if you wanna win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster,
faster,
don't be slow
Rev it up,
rev it up
'til your engines blows

You win my love
you win my soul
you win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love,
yeah you're number one

Oh, I'm a crazy little lady
yeah the kind you just can't slow down
Oh no
I need a '65 cylinder racy little run around town

Oh, but if you wanna win it
babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster,
faster,
and don't be slow
Rev it up,
rev it up
'til your engines blows

You win my love
you win my soul
you win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love,
yeah you're number one

I want a heartbreak Harley
A full steam dream machine
Or just a little late night
Sexy long stretch limousine

Oh, but if you wanna win it
babe, there's no speed limit
Just go faster,
faster,
don't be slow
Rev it up,
rev it up
'til your engines blows

You win my love
you win my soul
you win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You win my love
You make my motor run
You win my love,
yeah you're number one

You win my love ...
