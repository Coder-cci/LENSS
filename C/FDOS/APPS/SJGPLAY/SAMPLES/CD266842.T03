    1019 Hey it's me
    1108 what a big suprise
    1258 calling you up from a restaurant
    1439 'round the bend
    1971 I just got in from way up north
    2205 I'm aching tired now
    2372 and I could use a friend
    2798 I might be a fool
    3063 to think that you do
    3289 want to see me again
    3681 
    3899 I know it's been a while
    4119 since I talked to you
    4192 Nothing wrong
    4263 just nothing ever goes as planned
    4896 Many times I thought I'd call
    5134 I didn't have your number in my hand
    5722 Well I know it's true
    6000 you'd never do
    6213 the same thing to me
    6547 
    6640 I never meant to make you cry
    7123 and though I know I shouldn't call
    7611 It just reminds us of the cost
    7922 of everything we've lost
    8166 Bad timing that's all
    8598 And maybe soon there'll come a day
    9076 when no more tears will fall
    9563 We each forgive a little bit
    9874 and we both look back on it
   10088 as just bad timing that's all
   10578 
   13719 Used to have so many plans
   13946 Something always seemed to turn out wrong
   14649 I never could catch up to you
   14922 Moving on and doing all you've done
   15558 Well I don't know why the harder I try
   16030 the harder it comes
   16332 
   16424 I never meant to make you cry
   16909 and though I know I shouldn't call
   17405 It just reminds us of the cost
   17710 of everything we've lost
   17956 Bad timing that's all
   18355 
   18399 And maybe soon there'll come a day
   18866 when no more tears will fall
   19362 We each forgive a little bit
   19665 and we both look back on it
   19880 as just bad timing that's all
   20308 
   20355 We each forgive a little bit
   20637 and we both look back on it
   20851 as just bad timing that's all
