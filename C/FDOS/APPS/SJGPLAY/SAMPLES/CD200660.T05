All alone,
it's you and me
time to tell you now
just how I feel
Babe to you
I bare my heart
A light of love,
here in the dark

(Don-cha-know) I might be strong
But down deep there's a sweetness
Only you can touch
and make me feel
(Oh h h) what a joy
You're such a perfect lover
yes, You always know just what to do

I-I I need you ...
You know
You know I do
I-I I need you ...
when the going gets rough
you know I do

At the start
I couldn't say
All my feelings
I could not portray
But I gotta tell you now,
That I really need your love, babe
Oh, It's comin' on strong

(I feel) so secure
when you are here beside me
There is nothin'
that can bring me down
(Oh and) more and more
you take me way up high, Babe
and you teach me
what love is all about

Oh I-I I need you ...
a babe, You know
You know I do
(oh h h) I-I I need you ...
when the going gets rough
you know I do
