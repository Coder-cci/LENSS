    3161 Fire!
    3295 I can feel it
    3440 calling out to me
    3590 
    3673 And as the sun goes down
    3850 It starts to paint a picture
    4264 of an ancient town
    4421 So far away,
    4578 across the endless sea
    4736 
    4791 Ohhh,
    4874 Lead me to the light
    4996 And take me to the edge of heaven
    5366 I am standing in the night
    5567 And looking for the edge of heaven
    5830 We'll be touching the edge of heaven
    6435 
    6581 Time,
    6722 Close your eyes
    6833 see dreams of tomorrow
    7155 Time,
    7285 The wheels are turning
    7442 till eternity
    7588 
    7671 And as the darkness comes
    7848 I start to see a picture
    8257 of a lonely man,
    8415 so clearly now,
    8584 reaching out for me
    8722 
    8789 Ohhh,

@SONG: Ravine
    1694 Have you heard?
    1910 Have you heard?
    2150 About this girl who was ripped up
    2355 by her roots
    2572 Want to know
    2789 what she learned?
    3037 Like humility
    3182 you win when you lose
    3352 
    3451 I have learned
    3672 I have learned
    3916 The most horrifying nights have an end
    4330 I was hurt
    4551 I was lost
    4799 In the dark I found a way to a friend
    5094 
    5232 I am standing here in my ravine
    5677 Once again I see a piece of the sky
    6114 And my joy'll never be denied
    6417 'Cause I was meant to be here
    6634 The only place on earth
    6909 Where you are near
    7134 Where you are near
    7370 
    7638 Was a flower
    7863 So frail
    8092 And I let the trees grow wild around me
    8506 Grew so high,
    8723 hid the sky
    8975 Shaded everything I needed to see
    9289

    9604 someone came
    9852 Took a knife and ripped me up by my roots
   10262 Tossed astray
   10482 far away
   10734 In my darkest night I started to pray
   11006 
   11171 I am standing here in my ravine
   11613 Once again I see a piece of the sky
   12050 And my joy'll never be denied
   12350 'Cause I was meant to be here
   12570 The only place on earth
   12846 Where you are near
   13067 Where you are near
   13475 
   13645 Why do you...
   13865 Why do you ask?
   14085 Why I'm not blaming my god?
   14527 I tell you
   14743 I tell you what
   14968 He was the only one there
   15243

    1163 when you came to me
    1357 and asked for a dance
    1652 And I said "we can dance"
    1940 I felt like a queen
    2260 
    2365 Swedish summer nights are hot
    2723 and the trees can talk
    2926 We lay on the grass
    3217 So easily, so blessed
    3436 Whispers in blindness
    3709 And I didn't hold you back
    3904 
    4052 I'm talking about it, babe
    4247 cause you've been teasing me
    4446 I'm talking about it
    4637 cause you are
    4707 bad right through
    4949 Stay with me
    5023 and I shall want no other love
    5343 Stay with me
    5417 another love
    5507 another lie
    5651 
    5733 Stay with me
    5803 and I shall want no other love
    6048 And you were talking so sweet
    6200 But you were
    6270 touching and teasing
    6457 
    6664 I can hear the soft bells ring
    7022 through a thousand years
    7228 they call out to me
    7520 They say it's only once
    7809 in a life we love
    8085 
    8226 I can hear the soft bells ring
    8421 (only once, my dear)
    8584 through a thousand years
    8791 they call out to me
    9080 They say it's only once
    9209 (only once, my dear)
    9392 in a life we love
    9572 Now I've had the honour too
    9838 
    9916 I'm talking about it, babe
   10107 cause you've been teasing me
   10310 I'm talking about it
   10498 cause you are
   10575 bad right through
   10813 Stay with me
   10883 and I shall want no other love
   11207 Stay with me

   12415 Ooo, you were holding my hand
   12816 Ooo, you were kissing my skin
   13195 Ooo, you were holding my hand
   13597 Ooo, you were kissing my skin
   13827

   14335 (Stay with me)
   14401 another love, another lie
   14725 (Stay with me)
   14799 and I shall want no other love
   15033 (and you were talking so sweet)
   15197 but you were touchin' and teasin'
   15504 (Stay with me)
   15602 Trees are whisperin'
   15898 (Stay with me)
