     577 I was alone, I took ride
     715 I didn't know what I would find there
    1110 another road where maybe I
    1239 could see another kind of mind there
    1605 Ooo, then I suddenly see you
    1871 Ooo, did I tell you I need you
    2142 every single day of my life

    2688 You didn't run, you didn't lie
    2815 You knew I wanted just to hold you
    3213 And had you gone, you knew in time
    3343 we'd meet again for I adored you

    6512 
    6606 Ooo, then I suddenly see you
    6866 Ooo, did I tell you I need you
    7139 every single day of my life
