Lost
in a dream
I don't know which
way to go

(let me say that)

You are all
that you seem
Then baby
I'm movin'
way too slow

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
in the slammin' door
How about some information
please

Straight up
now tell me
Do you really
want to love me forever
oh oh oh
Or am I caught in
a hit and run
Straight up
now tell me
Is it gonna be you
and me together
oh oh oh
Or are you just havin' fun

Time's standing still
waiting for some
small clue

(let me tell you now)

I keep getting chills
when I think your love
is true

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
in the slammin' door
How about some information
please

Straight up
now tell me
Do you really
want to love me forever
oh oh oh
Or am I caught in
a hit and run
Straight up
now tell me
Is it gonna be you
and me together
oh oh oh
Are you just having fun

You are so hard to read
you play hide and seek
with your true
intentions
If you're only playing games
I'll just have to say
bye bye bye
Bye bye bye
bye bye bye

Do do you love me
do do you love me, baby
Do do you love me
do do you love me, hey baby
do do you love me
do do you love me, baby
(Come on now)
do do you love me
do do you love me, tell me baby

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
in the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page
in your history
book
I don't mean to make demands
but the word
and the deed
go hand in hand
How about some information
please
please, a please, please
