     469 It felt like spring time
     621 on this February morning
     827 In a courtyard
     923 birds were singing
    1041 your praise
    1320 I'm still recalling
    1456 things you said
    1547 to make me feel
    1684 alright
    1770 I carried them with me
    1878 today now
    1941 
    1955 As I lay me
    2155 down to sleep
    2320 this I pray
    2469 that you will hold me dear
    2725 though I'm far away
    2843 I'll whisper
    3021 your name
    3148 into the sky
    3314 and I will wake up happy
    3471 
    3599 I wonder why
    3909 I feel so high
    4016 though I am not above the sorrow
    4271 heavy hearted
    4363 till you call my name
    4645 and it sounds like church bells
    4809 or the whistle of a train
    4972 on a summer evening
    5106 I'll run to meet you
    5217 barefoot
    5276 barely breathing
    5354 
    5388 As I lay me
    5600 down to sleep
    5761 this I pray
    5910 that you will hold me dear
    6161 though I'm far away
    6285 I'll whisper
    6461 your name
    6589 into the sky
    6754 and I will wake up happy
    6946 
    7024 oh darling
    7087 
    7109 As I lay me
    7320 down to sleep
    7478 this I pray
    7619 that you will hold me dear
    7880 though I'm far away
    8011 I'll whisper
    8182 your name
    8306 into the sky
    8489 and I will wake up happy
    8628 
    8857 It's not too near
    8999 for me
    9106 like a flower I need the rain
    9283 though it's not clear
    9445 to me
    9545 every season has its change
    9713 and I will see you
    9861 when the sun comes out again
   10162 
   10331 As I lay me
   10548 down to sleep
   10707 this I pray
   10859 that you will hold me dear
   11106 though I'm far away
   11231 I'll whisper
   11410 your name
   11537 into the sky
   11705 and I will wake up happy
   11714 
   12053 As I lay me
   12266 down to sleep
   12425 this I pray
   12572 that you will hold me dear
   12823 though I'm far away
   12947 I'll whisper
   13126 your name
   13253 into the sky
   13424 and I will wake up happy
   13640 
   13883 I wonder why
   14450 mmmm
   14599 the sun comes out again
   14805 and the sun comes out again
   15019 when the sun comes out again
   15235 when the sun comes out again
   15387 
   15395 ohhh
   15444 the sun comes out again
   15671 when the sun comes out again
   15833 mmmm
   15957 comes out
   16046 comes out
   16219 I will wake up happy
   16617 as I pray
