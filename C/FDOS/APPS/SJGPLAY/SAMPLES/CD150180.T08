Lazy eyes in the summer heat,
fresh from outta town.
Now she's working
on the street,
shakin' poor boys down.

Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
Oh, Girl gone bad, ya

Found that girl
with a lonesome John,
but she should've been with me.
Guess that woman fallen in love,
she don't work for free

Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
Ah ah ah...

Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
Oh, Girl gone bad, ya
