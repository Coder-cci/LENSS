; TITLE: I feel too much
; CD   : Celine Dion - Unison
; ------
I just wanted you to talk to me
But Baby you captured
my heart so easy
And I know love,
baby when I see it
Boy when you're near me
that's the feeling I get

It's pure emotion inside of me
And all I know is I feel ...

Too much,
Too much baby
all I do is think
about you night and day
I feel too
Too much,
too much baby
don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'

The spell that I'm under
I can't undo
But Baby I wonder
do you feel it too

A classic case of infatuation
Is it possible I feel ...

Too much,
Too much baby
all I do is think
about you night and day
I feel too
Too much,
too much baby
don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'

It's a serious connection
when I look in your eyes
When you show me your affection,
it's more than I realized

Too much,
Too much baby
all I do is think
about you night and day
I feel too
Too much,
too much baby
don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'

Too much,
Too much baby
all I do is think
about you night and day
I feel too
Too much,
too much baby
don't let go 'cause
It's my heart you're takin'

Too much,
Too much
don't take my heart away
too much
I feel too
Too much,
