    3086 There's a time
    3402 and place
    3765 for you to make your mark
    4090 and show your face
    4382 There's a place
    4682 in time
    5056 When you must step outside the line
    5626 
    5805 So understand
    6223 what I mean
    6542 there is a time and place
    6740 for you to have your dream
    7250 But here and now
    7591 may not be
    7894 the time and place for you
    8215 and me
    8389 you and me
    8783 
    8879 It's the finest line
    9544 A missed opportunity
    9873 or the perfect time
   10155 You must not
   10521 despair
   10840 You'll recognise it when you're there

   13677 the time and place for you
   14013 and me
   14324 the time and place for you and me
   14627 there's a time and there's a moment
   14894 you will see
   15342 
   16145 Don't lower your expectations
   16602 there are no limitations
   16951 there's a time and place, baby
   17378 for you and me
   17818
