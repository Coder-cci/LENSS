     874 A broken man without a home
    1224 Desperate and so alone
    1591 A victim of society
    1922 No one really wants to see
    2263 Some of us don't even wonder
    2616 Some of us don't even care
    2959 Couldn't we just help each other
    3307 Isn't there enough to share
    3634 
    3709 There's got to be a way
    4050 To connect this world today
    4397 Come together to relieve the pain
    4896 (There's just got to be a)
    5114 There's got to be a way
    5446 To unite this human race
    5794 And together we'll bring on a change
    6149 (we'll bring on a change)
    6364 
    6466 In another land they still believe
    6785 Color grants supremacy
    7149 I don't understand
    7272 How there can be
    7484 Regulated bigotry
    7819 Some of us don't even wonder
    8171 Some of us don't even care
    8528 Couldn't we accept each other
    8873 Can't we make ourselves aware

   11963 
   12059 And maybe then the future will be a time
   12451 Without war, destitution and sorrow
   12776 And hungry children
   12928 Won't have to die (Ohh)
   13217 If we work together today
   13361 We'll save tomorrow (Yeah)
   13660 Hey
