    2399 After seven days
    2760 he was quite tired
    2980 so God said;
    3215 "Let there be a day
    3544 just for picnics
    3779 with wine and bread"
    4062 He gathered up
    4172 some people he had made
    4454 created blankets
    4595 and laid back in the shade
    5019 The people sipped their wine
    5348 and what with God there
    5583 they asked him questions, like...
    5866 "Do you have to eat
    6164 or get your hair cut
    6415 in heaven?
    6681 And if your eye
    6823 got poked out in this life
    7089 would it be waiting
    7183 up in heaven with your wife?"
    7560 
    7654 God shuffled his feet
    7983 and glanced around
    8203 at them
    8438 the people cleared their throats
    8799 and stared right back
    9018 at him
    9270 
    9364 So he said...
    9474 "Once there was a boy
    9866 who woke up
   10054 with blue hair
   10274 to him it was a joy
   10634 till he ran out
   10870 to the warm air.
   11136 He thought of how
   11267 his friends would come and see
   11544 would they laugh or had
   11680 he got some strange disease"
   12125 
   12125 God shuffled his feet
   12438 and glanced around at them
   12893 the people cleared their throats
   13254 and stared right back
   13458 at him
   13788 
   14252 The people sat waiting
   14565 hot on their blankets
   14816 in the garden
   15020 but, God said nothing
   15365 so someone asked him
   15600 beg your pardon
   15898 Not quite clear
   16039 about what you just spoke
   16306 was that a parable
   16432 or a very subtle joke?
   16777 
   16855 God shuffled his feet
   17200 and glanced around at them
   17640 the people cleared their throats
   18000 and stared right back
   18220 at him
