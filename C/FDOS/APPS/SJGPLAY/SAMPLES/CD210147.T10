You don't think that I'll be strong enough
no ooo baby, now
I won't be a prisoner of your love

??????????     'cause
I'm not going to be a prisoner of your love
I know you're lyin', denyin'
all of your actions
so listen up, 'cause here's my retraction

Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
Always tried so hard to keep me down
But now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations
Take you by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy
I see through your disguise
All the dreams
we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand, yes
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
Noooo baby now,
I won't be a prisoner
of your love
(prisoner of your love)

No longer blind
I can focus on deception
Used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery
There's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now
To change the way I feel inside
All the dreams
we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand, yeah
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

You don't think that I'll be strong enough
Noooo baby now,
I won't be prisoner of your love
(prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
not gonna be a prisoner
I won't be a prisoner of your love

your love

Don't be a prisoner
I don't be a prisoner
no
um hmmmm
Don't be a prisoner
I don't be a prisoner


??????


Noooo baby now,
I won't be prisoner of your love
(prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
not gonna be a prisoner
I won't be a prisoner of your love

????????

See ya,
