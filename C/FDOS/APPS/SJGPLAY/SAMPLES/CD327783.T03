     114 Ooo...
     777 
    1200 How
    1443 How can it be
    1695 that a love
    1800 carved out of caring
    1968 fashioned by fate
    2124 could suffer so hard
    2364 from the games
    2478 played once too often
    2697 
    2790 but making mistakes
    3048 is a part
    3147 of life's imperfections
    3339 born of the years
    3504 is it so wrong
    3744 to be human
    3846 after all
    4017 
    4146 drawn into the stream
    4407 of undefined illusion
    4833 those diamond dreams
    5088 they can't diguise the truth
    5496 that there is something about you
    5793 baby
    5928 so right
    6180 I wouldn't be without you
    6411 baby
    6624 tonight
    6798 
    6909 if ever our love
    7134 was concealed
    7266 no-one can say that
    7428 we didn't feel
    7608 million things
    7848 and a perfect dream of life
    8190 gone
    8295 fragile but free
    8532 we remain
    8637 tender together
    8796 if not so in love
    8979 it's not so wrong
    9171 we're only human after all
    9504 
    9624 these changing years
    9873 they add to your confusion
   10281 oh and you need to hear
   10557 the time
   10644 that told the truth
   10902 
   10968 because there's something about you (something about)
   11244 baby (the way you are)
   11418 so right (so right)
   11646 I couldn't live without you (I couldn't live)
   11892 baby (without you here)
   12099 tonight
   13521 
   13770 oooohhh
   14835 
   15069 I'm glad theres something about you
   15300 yaaaa
   15777 and I couldn't live without you
   16203 tonight
   16443
