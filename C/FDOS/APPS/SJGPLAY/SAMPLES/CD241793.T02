    1517 Works in the streets
    1633 Just a moan in the heat as night descends
    2117 two searching lives
    2227 cut their way into mine,
    2387 inviting me
    2717 dancing so close
    2843 we aready know
    2974 how good it will be
    3310 We slipped out from the unseen crowd
    3573 we find what we need
    3669 
    3837 In the heart of the night
    4323 we run like bandits
    4612 two hungry hearts
    4812 under the gun
    5045 In the heart of the night
    5470 when we find each other
    5812 we're stealin' love
    6004 on the run
    6190 In the heart of the night
    6522 heart of the night
    6627 
    7774 Who set him up
    7873 raise its touch on the room
    8024 your eyes reach to me
    8352 two shadows fall
    8472 saying nothing at all
    8645 we know what we need
    8961 When they're released
    9085 two prisoners are free
    9203 from the darkness
    9566 One more escape
    9688 surviving the heartache and madness
    9771 
   10088 In the heart of the night
   10556 we run like bandits
   10859 two hungry hearts
   11055 under the gun
   11272 In the heart of the night
   11715 when we find each other
   12063 we're stealing love
   12247 on the run
   12420 In the heart of the night
   12732 heart of the night
   12851 
   13944 In the heart of the night
   14373 when we find each other
   14699 we're stealing love
   14892 on the run
   15068 In the heart of the night
   15395 heart of the night
   15768 
   15997 In the heart of the night
   16620 
   17139 In the heart of the night
   17527 
   17712 In the heart of the night
