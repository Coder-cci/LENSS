     211 It doesn't matter what I say
     545 You never listen anyway
     961 Just don't know
    1170 what you're looking for
    1351 
    1540 Imagination's all I have
    1880 But ever then you say it's bad
    2275 Just can't see
    2487 why we disagree
    2647 
    2732 And casual conversations
    2940 how they bore me
    3393 Ya, They go on and on
    3591 endlessly
    4051 But no matter what I say
    4258 You'll ignore me anyway
    4709 I might as well talk in my sleep
    5162 I could weep
    5298 
    5483 You try to make me feel so small
    5810 Until there's nothing left at all
    6222 Why go on?
    6435 Just hoping that we'll get along
    7838 
    8015 There's no communication
    8218 left between us
    8678 But is it me or you
    8881 who's to blame?
    9342 There's nothing I can do,
    9532 yes you're fading
    9693 out of view
    9986 Don't know if I feel
   10187 joy or pain
   10440 such a shame
   10639 
   10771 And now it seems it's all been said
   11098 If you must leave
   11189 then go ahead
   11515 Should feel sad
   11683 But I really believe that I'm glad
   12066 I really believe that I'm glad
   12397 I really believe that I'm glad
   13027
