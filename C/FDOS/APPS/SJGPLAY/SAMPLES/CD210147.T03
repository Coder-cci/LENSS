    1775 Once again we sit in silence
    2380 After all is said and done
    2943 Only emptiness inside us
    3505 Baby, look what we've become
    4008 We can make a million promises
    4225 But we still won't change
    4566 It isn't right to stay together
    4761 When you only bring each other pain
    5117 
    5130 I don't wanna cry
    5408 Don't wanna cry
    5630 Nothing in the world
    5730 Could take us back
    5884 To where we used to be
    6106 Though I've given you my heart and soul
    6441 (given you my heart and soul)
    6663 I must find a way of letting go
    6979 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
    7769 I don't wanna cry, Yeah
    8284 
    8418 Too far apart to bridge the distance
    8970 But something keeps us hanging on and on
    9536 Pretending not to know the difference
   10086 Denying what we had is gone
   10622 Every moment we're together
   10792 It's just breaking me down
   11150 I know we swore it was forever
   11311 But it hurts too much to stay around
   11722 
   11763 I don't wanna cry
   11968 Don't wanna cry
   12232 Nothing in the world
   12337 Could take us back
   12499 To where we used to be
   12703 Though I've given you my heart and soul
   13054 (given you my heart and soul)
   13276 I must find a way of letting go
   13576 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
   14174 Hmmm
   14347 I don't wanna cry
   14558 No ohhh
   14838 
   15042 All the magic's gone
   15226 There's just a shadow of a memory
   15593 Something just went wrong
   15769 We can't go on make-believing
   16055 on make-believing
   16388 
   16403 'cause I don't wanna cry
   16701 Don't wanna cry
   16913 Nothing in the world
   17013 Could take us back
   17165 To where we used to be
   17390 Though I've given you my heart and soul
   17724 (given you my heart and soul)
   17965 Though I've given you my heart and soul
   18286 (given you my heart and soul)
   18489 I must find a way of letting go
   18816 'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
   19416 Hmmm .. cry
   20152 I don't wanna cry
   20464 mmmmmm
   20670 I don't wanna cry
