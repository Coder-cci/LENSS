    2553 Why do we never get an answer
    2800 when we're knocking at the door?
    3042 With a thousand million questions
    3268 about hate and death and war
    3497 'Cause when we stop and look around us
    3752 there is nothing that we need
    3983 in a world of persecution
    4226 that is burning in its greed
    4440 
    4484 Ahhhh
    4954 Ahhhh
    5420 Ah ah ah
    5959 
    6078 Why do we never get an answer
    6323 when we're knocking at the door?
    6544 Because the truth is hard to swallow
    6773 that's what the war of love is for
    7270 
    7868 It's not the way that you say it
    8150 when you do those things to me
    8393 It's more the way that you mean it
    8659 when you tell me what will be
    8990 
    9039 And when you stop and think about it
    9357 you won't believe it's true
    9576 that all the love you've been giving
    9880 has all been meant for you
   10175 
   10233 I'm looking for someone to change my life
   10777 I'm looking for a miracle in my life
   11228 and if you could see
   11513 what it's done to me
   11739 to loose the love I knew
   12004 could safely lead me through
   12335 
   12375 Between the silence of the mountains
   12688 and the crashing of the sea
   12921 there lies the land I once lived in
   13230 and she's waiting there for me
   13520 
   13584 But in the gray of the morning
   13922 my mind becomes confused
   14142 between the dead and the sleeping
   14421 and the road that I must choose
   14819 
   14819 I'm looking for someone to change my life
   15351 I'm looking for a miracle in my life
   15805 And if you could see
   16090 what it's done to me
   16309 to loose the love I knew
   16568 could safely lead me to
   16818 the land that I once new
   17064 To learn as we grow old
   17332 the secrets of our soul
   17679 
   17805 It's not the way that you say it
   18112 when you do those things to me
   18357 It's more the way you really mean it
   18643 when you tell me what will be
   19200 
   21732 Why do we never get an answer...
