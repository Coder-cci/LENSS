;------- 
     609 It was an early morning yesterday
     936 I was up before the dawn
    1323 And I really have enjoyed my stay
    1635 But I must be movin' on
    1841 
    2004 Like a king without a castle
    2163 Like a queen without a throne
    2313 I'm an early morning lover
    2478 And I must be movin' on
    2756 
    2928 Now I believe in what you say
    3233 Is the undisputed truth
    3597 But I have to have things my own way
    3897 To keep me in my youth
    4176 
    4265 Like a ship without an achor
    4410 Like a slave without a chain
    4560 Just the thought of those sweet ladies
    4701 Sends a shiver through my veins
    4821 
    4863 And I will go on shining
    5031 Shining like brand new
    5178 I'll never look behind me
    5307 My troubles will be few
    5844 
    6746 Goodbye stranger
    6894 it's been nice
    7037 Hope you find your
    7181 paradise
    7315 Tried to see your
    7470 point of view
    7610 Hope your dreams will
    7757 all come true
    7883 Goodbye Mary,
    8034 Goodbye Jane
    8192 Will we ever
    8318 meet again
    8475 Feel no sorrow,
    8601 feel no shame
    8745 Come tomorrow,
    8888 feel no pain
    8949 
    8972 Sweet devotion (Goodbye Mary)
    9110 it's not for me (Goodbye Jane)
    9258 just give me motion (will we ever)
    9411 set me free (meet again)
    9560 Land in the ocean (feel no sorrow)
    9702 far away (feel no shame)
    9819 It's the life I've chosen (come tomorrow)
    9990 every day (feel no pain)
   10103 So goodbye Mary (goodbye Mary)
   10272 Goodbye Jane (goodbye Jane)

   10923 
   11157 Now some they do
   11241 and some they don't
   11472 And some you just can't tell
   11826 And some they will
   11894 and some they won't
   12123 With some
   12153 it's just as well
   12350 
   12470 You can laugh at my behavior
   12626 That'll never bother me
   12755 Say the devil is my savior
   12930 But I don't pay no heed
   13049 
   13080 And I will go on shining
   13217 Shining like brand new
   13362 I'll never look behind me
   13496 My troubles will be few
   13632 
   13830 [whistle solo]
