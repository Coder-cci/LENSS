@SONG: It's All Coming Back To Me Now
    3676 There were nights when the wind
    3809 was so cold
    4087 That my body froze in bed
    4260 If I just listened to it
    4431 Right outside the window
    4670 
    4875 There were days when the sun
    5017 was so cruel
    5241 That all the tears turned to dust
    5458 An I just knew my eyes were
    5628 drying up forever (forever)
    5847 
    6121 I finished crying in the instant
    6320 that you left
    6465 And I can't remember where
    6618 or when or how
    6850 And I banished every memory
    7038 you and I had ever made
    7329 
    7711 But when you touch me like this
    7890 and you hold me like that
    8181 I just have to admit
    8364 That it's all coming back to me
    8651 When I touch you like this
    8834 and I hold you like that
    9094 It's so hard to believe but
    9287 It's all coming back to me
    9588 (It's all coming,
    9710 it's all coming back to me now)
    9989 
   10024 There were moments of gold
   10141 And there were flashes of light
   10386 There were things
   10438 I'd never do again
   10534 But then they'd always seemed right
   10766 There were nights of endless pleasure
   10968 It was more than any laws allow
   11505 Baby Baby
   11618 
   11645 If I kiss you like this
   11865 And if you whisper like that
   12104 It was lost long ago
   12247 But it's all coming back to me
   12495 If you want me like this
   12666 And if you need me like that
   12914 It was dead long ago
   13056 But it's all coming back to me
   13316 It's so hard to resist
   13457 And it's all coming back to me
   13711 I can barely recall
   13850 But it's all coming back to me now
   14814 But it's all coming back
   15045 
   15875 There were those empty threats
   16000 and hollow lies
   16320 and whenever you tried to hurt me
   16475 I just hurt you even worse
   16671 And so much deeper
   17073 There were hours that just
   17202 went on for days
   17437 when alone at last
   17594 we'd count up all the chances
   17760 That were lost to us forever
   18043 
   18313 But you were history
   18457 with the slamming of the door
   18628 
   18666 And I made myself so strong
   18806 again somehow
   19070 And I never wasted
   19187 any of my time
   19312 on you since then
   19584 
   19903 But if I touch you like this
   20072 And if you kiss me like that
   20357 It was so long ago
   20563 But it's all coming back to me
   20853 If you touch me like this
   21062 And if I kiss you like that
   21282 It was gone with the wind
   21478 But it's all coming back to me
   21772 (It's all coming back,
   21885 it's all coming back to me now)
   22167 
   22190 There were moments of gold
   22325 And there were flashes of light
   22574 There were things
   22616 we'd never do again
   22723 But then they'd always seemed right
   22945 There were nights of endless pleasure
   23162 It was more than any laws allow
   23620 Baby Baby Baby
   23780 
   23801 When you touch me like this
   24029 And when you hold me like that
   24242 It was gone with the wind
   24405 But it's all coming back to me
   24656 When you see me like this
   24824 And when I see you like that
   25022 Then we see what we want to see
   25279 All coming back to me
   25481 The flesh and the fantasies
   25665 All coming back to me
   25858 I can barely recall
   25993 But it's all coming back to me now
   26404 
   28177 If you forgive me all this
   28440 If I forgive you all that
   28746 We forgive and forget
   28909 and it's all coming back to me
   29232 when you see me like this
   29451 and when I see you like that
   29723 We see just what we want to see
   29947 All coming back to me
   30187 The flesh and the fantasies
   30375 All coming back to me
   30590 I can barely recall
   30744 But it's all coming back to me now
   31289 
   31323 (it's all coming back to me now)
   31592 And when you kiss me like this
   31799 (it's all coming back to me now)
   32104 And when I touch you like that
   32306 (it's all coming back to me now)
   32630 If you do it like this
   32816 (it's all coming back to me now)
   33195 And if we

@SONG: Because You Loved Me

    6049 You gave me wings and made me fly
    6335 you touched my hand
    6489 I could touch the sky
    6646 I lost my faith,
    6779 you gave it back to me
    6936 You said no star was out of reach
    7238 You stood by me and I stood tall
    7546 I had your love
    7690 I had it all
    7906 I'm grateful for each day you gave me

   12706 into my life
   13016 You've been my inspiration
   13279 Through the lies
   13392 you were the truth
   13608 My world is a better place
   13846 because of you
   14149

@SONG: Falling Into You
    1009 And in your eyes
    1341 I see
    1409 ribbons of color
    1792 I see
    1912 us inside
    2179 of each other
    2486 I feel my unconscious merge with yours
    2879 And I hear a voice say
    3146 "What's his is hers"
    3333 
    3433 I'm falling into you
    3593 (falling into you)
    3837 This dream could come true
    4195 And it feels so good
    4403 (falling into you)
    4593 falling into you
    4849 
    4956 I was afraid
    5255 to let you
    5429 in here
    5677 Now I have learned
    5953 love can't be made in fear
    6414 The walls begin to tumble down
    6781 And I can even
    7063 see the ground
    7317 
    7334 I'm falling into you
    7519 (falling into you)
    7759 This dream could come true
    8107 And it feels so good
    8320 (falling into you)
    8489 falling into you
    8732 
    8732 Falling like a leaf,
    9112 falling like a star
    9563 Finding a belief,
    9970 falling where you are
   10394 
   10477 Catch me,
   10588 don't let me drop
   10838 Love me, don't ever stop
   11221 
   12527 So close your eyes
   12892 and let me kiss you
   13275 And while you sleep
   13692 I will miss you
   14009 
   14009 I'm falling into you
   14204 (falling into you)
   14431 This dream could come true
   14798 And it feels so good
   15013 (falling into you)
   15196 falling into you
   15503 
   15503 Falling like a leaf,
   15793 falling like a star
   16296 Finding a belief,
   16665 falling where you are
   17066 
   17290 falling into you
   17674 Falling into you
   18040 falling into you

@SONG: Seduces Me
    1178 Everything you are
    1469 everything you'll be
    1736 touches the current of love
    2097 So deep in me
    2380 Every sigh
    2462 in the night
    2688 Every tear
    2777 that you cry
    2987 Seduces me
    3269 
    3615 And all that I am
    3913 and all that I'll be
    4193 Means nothing at all
    4483 If you can't be with me

    5103 Or your sweetest caress
    5422 Seduces me
    5725 
    5945 I don't care
    6051 about tomorrow

@SONG: All By Myself
     411 When I was young
     584 I never needed anyone
    1038 And making love
    1201 was just for fun
    1509 Those days are gone
    1981 Livin' alone
    2249 I think of all
    2385 friends I've known
    2733 When I dial the telephone
    3154 Nobody's home
    3357 
    3961 All by myself
    4441 Don't wanna be
    4590 All by myself
    4967 Anymore
    5141 
    5141 Hard to be sure
    5374 Sometimes I feel so insecure
    5816 And loves so distant
    5971 and obscure
    6206 Remains the cure
    6380

    9354 
   11926 When I was young

   12646 making love

    4116 I know what's right

    5916 the bitter cold
    6224 But life without you,
    6533 I don't know

    8618 But I get right up
    8916 and I stand my ground
    9240 I've tasted fear,
    9542 my share of pain
    9850 The wasted tears of love in vain
   10448 I've held you tight,
   10748 pushed you away
   11009 Now with all my might
   11325 I beg you to stay

   14922 I must believe
   15244 Deep in the night
   15516 by a dying flame
   15853 You will be there when
   16149 I call your name
   16469 
   16448 I'm sure I could face
   16725 the bitter cold
   17017 But life without you,

   12075 angels sing

   12694 Go now,
   12866 find the light
