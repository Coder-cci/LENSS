; TITLE: I'm Gonna Be Strong

I can see
you're slipping away from me
and your so afraid
I'll beg you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
let you go your way

and now he's gone
and there's no sense
in holding on
and your pitty now
would be too much to bear
So I'm gonna be strong
and pretend
I don't care
I'm gonna be strong
and stand as tall I can
Yes I'm gonna be strong
let you run along
as if I don't
give a damn

I'm gonna be strong
and let you run along
as if I don't
give a damn

When you say
"here she is"
I'll just send you a line
all the while smiling, say
"don't you worry,
I'm fine"
and you may not know darling
after you kissed me goodbye
I want to break down and
cry

break down and cry

break down and cry
