     662 Well I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday
    1107 Parkin' by the lake and there was not another car in sight
    1502 and I never had a girl looking any better than you did
    1929 And all the kids at school they were wishin' they were me that night
    2265 
    2357 And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
    2719 It never felt so good, it never felt so right
    3078 And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
    3306 glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

   16139 Ok, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker goin' here
   16326 Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
   16586 There's the wind up, and there it is, a line shot up the middle
   16799 Look at him go, this boy can really fly, he's rounding first
   17005 and really turning it on now, he's not letting up at all
   17214 he's gonna try for second. The ball is bobbled out in centre and
   17425 Here comes the throw, and what a throw! He's gonna slide in head first
   17676 here he comes, he's out! No wait, safe, safe at second base
   17961 this kid really makes things happen out there.
   18163 Batter steps up to the plate, here's the pitch, and he's going
   18382 and what a jump he's got, he's trying for third, here's the throw,
   18587 It's in the dirt - safe at third! Holy cow, stolen base!
   18883 He's taking a pretty big lead off, almost daring him to try and pick him off
   19166 Pitcher glances over, winds up, and it's bunted, bunted down the
   19363 third base line, the suicide squeeze is on. Here he comes, squeeze play,
   19648 it's gonna be close, here's the throw, here's the play at the plate,
   19879 holy cow I think he's gonna make it!
