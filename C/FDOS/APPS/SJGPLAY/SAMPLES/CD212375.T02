    2218 Every generation
    2575 blames the one before
    2937 And all of their frustrations
    3297 come beating on your door
    3665 I know that I'm a prisoner
    3808 To all my father held so dear
    4037 I know that I'm a hostage
    4221 To all his hopes and fears
    4378 I just wish I could have told him
    4606 In the living years
    4999 
    5108 Wo-oh
    5164 Crumpled bits of paper
    5477 Filled with imperfect thought
    5892 Stilted conversions
    6211 I'm afraid that's all we've got
    6512 
    6613 You say you just don't see it
    6803 He says it's perfect sense
    6987 You just can't get agreement
    7165 in this present tense
    7317 We all talk a different language
    7552 Talking in defence
    7939 
    8013 (Say it loud)
    8211 Say it loud
    8354 (Say it clear)
    8534 Wo-oh say it clear
    8747 (You can listen)
    8973 as well as you hear
    9479 (It's too late)
    9688 It's too late
    9844 (When we die)
   10021 wo-oh when we die
   10216 (to admit)
   10371 we don't see
   10567 eye to eye
   10890 
   10992 So we open up a quarrel
   11353 between the present and the past
   11707 We only sacrifice the future
   12090 It's the bitterness that lasts
   12404 
   12494 So don't yield to the fortunes
   12687 You sometimes see as fate
   12836 It may have a new perspective
   13060 on a different day
   13213 and if you don't give up
   13333 and don't give in
   13422 you may just be okay.

   15339 Because it's too late

   16447 eye to eye
   16866 
   16922 I wasn't there that morning
   17246 when my father passed away
   17648 I didn't get to tell him
   17981 all the things I had to say
   18390 I think I caught his spirit
   18577 later that same year
   18744 I'm sure I heard his echo
   18912 in my baby's new born tears
