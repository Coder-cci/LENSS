    1303 I didn't know when I was lucky
    1659 Discontented, feeling bad
    1989 Filed with envy
    2150 for possessions other people had
    2444 
    2626 I found my pride
    2744 had always hurt me
    2978 Fought the world to gain control
    3287 Not realisin'
    3475 I was sitting on a beach of gold
    3762 
    3884 Oh lord I'm a poor man
    4215 with all the riches I can hold
    4630 I'm a beggar
    4794 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
    5116 
    5301 The problems I encountered
    5624 gave me strength helped me sustain
    5931 To know the pleasure
    6161 first I had to cure the pain
    6470 
    6592 When I was searchin' for solutions
    6918 I found the answer lay in me
    7273 I'm a drifter
    7438 but I'm driftin' on a silver sea
    7692 
    7843 Oh lord I'm a poor man
    8177 with all the riches I can hold
    8594 I'm a beggar
    8757 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
    9062 
    9355 I didn't have courage
    9518 my life was as dark as night
   10000 When alone in the darkness
   10202 I saw the brightest light
   10468 Let the light shine down
   11528 
   11895 Are you out there now on empty
   12227 Feel you've nothin' left to give
   12558 sick of tryin'
   12761 Have you lost the will to live?
   13044 
   13208 Don't be drownin' in the shallows
   13547 with the beach so near at hand
   13858 Hear the voice say
   14025 Stand up get up
   14192 and join me on the gilded sand
   14336 
   14453 Come and join me on the beach
   14780 with all the riches I can hold
   15177 Cause I'm a beggar
   15360 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
   15685 
   15750 Wo lord I'm a poor man
   16101 with all the riches I can hold
   16520 I'm a beggar
   16703 I'm sitting on a beach of gold
   17006 
   17095 My children my salvation
   17518 the father to this man
   17819 they're my teachers
   18008 paying on the golden sand
   18342 
   18387 With my family all around me
   18748 I've all the riches I can hold
   19153 I'm a beggar
   19362 sitting on a beach of gold
   19679 
   19736 Oh lord I'm a poor man
