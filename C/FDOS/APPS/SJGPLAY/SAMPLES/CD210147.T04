    2057 You were so blind to let me go
    2389 You had it all but didn't know
    2716 No one you'll ever find will be
    2999 Closer to all your dreams than me
    3350 Believing the grass would be greener
    3659 You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
    3991 But I know you'll soon discover
    4251 You're never satisfied with any other
    4628 
    4628 Someday Oo Someday

    6313 Soon as you find they're all the same
    6652 And when you find yourself alone

   11284 That there'll ever come a time
   11378 when you're cold and lonely
