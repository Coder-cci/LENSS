895      Slip inside the eye of your mind
1199     Don't you know you might find
1458     A better place to play
1770     You said that you'd never been
2068     But all the things that you've seen
2346     Will slowly fade away...
2498
2673     So I start a revolution from my bed
3069     Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
3521     Step outside the summertime's in bloom
3956     Stand up beside the fireplace
4190     Take that look from off your face
4410     You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
4980
5285     So Sally can wait,
5583     she knows its too late
5760     As were walking on by
6150     Her soul slides away,
6540     but don't look back in anger
6753     I heard you say
6939
7700     Take me to the place where you go
8003     Where nobody knows
8280     If it's night or day
8586     Please don't put your life in my hands
8886     Or a Rock 'n Roll band
9154     Who'll throw it all away...
9300
9491     Gonna start a revolution from my bed
9875     Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
10315    Step outside the summertime's in bloom
10780    Stand up beside the fireplace
11000    Take that look from off your face
11209    Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
11762
12098    So Sally, can wait,
12398    she knows its too late
12585    as she's walking on by
12951    My soul slides away
13350    But don't look back in anger
13572    I heard you say...
13714
16490    So Sally can wait,
16804    she knows it's too late
16965    as were walking away
17361    So slides away,
17745    Don't look back in anger,
17958    I heard you say.
18245    So Sally can wait,
18559    she knows it's too late
18735    as she's walking away...
18996
19127    So slides away,
19512    don't look back in anger
19748    don't look back in anger...
19970
20172    I heard you say...
