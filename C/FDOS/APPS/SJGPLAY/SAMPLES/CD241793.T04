Break it
to me gently
let me down
the easy way
Make me feel
you still love me
if it just,
just for one more day

Break it
to me gently
so my tears,
my tears won't fall
too fast
If you must go
then go slowly
Let me love you
to the last
the love we shared
oh so long
it's such a big part of me
if you must take
your love away
take it gradually

And break it to me gently
give me time
oh, give me a little time
to ease the pain
If you must go
then go slowly
'cause I'll never love again

If you must take
your love away
take it gradually
And break it to me gently
give me time
oh, give me a little time
to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer
'cause I'll never,
never love again
'cause I'll never love,
I'll never love again
