      35 I've paid my dues
     328 time after time
     632 I've done my sentence
     883 but committed no crime
    1204 And bad mistakes
    1494 I've made a few
    1791 I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    2053 but I've come through

    2289 on and on and on and on..)
    2480

    3115 and we'll keep on fighting
    3394 till the end
    3716 We are the champions
    3997 We are the champions
    4284 no time for losers
    4543 cause we are the champions
    4940 of the world

    6359 you brought me fame and fortune
    6524 and everything that goes with it
    6683 I thank you all
    6882 But it's been no bed of roses
    7216 no pleasure cruise
    7465 I consider it a challenge
    7601 before the whole human race
    7765 and I'm gonna loose
    7931 (And the beats are going
    8005 on and on and on and on..)
