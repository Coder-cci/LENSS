    4013 On a dark desert highway
    4257 Cool wind in my hair
    4501 Warm smell of colitas
    4731 rising up through the air
    4987 Up ahead in the distance
    5217 I saw a shimmering light
    5464 My head grew heavy
    5541 and my sight grew dim
    5717 I had to stop for the night
    5968 
    5968 There she stood in the doorway
    6199 I heard the mission bell
    6475 And I was thinking to myself
    6617 this could be Heaven
    6720 or this could be Hell
    6944 Then she lit up a candle
    7188 And she showed me the way
    7433 There were voices down the corridor
    7663 I thought I heard them say
    7830 
    7921 Welcome to the Hotel California
    8349 Such a lovely place
    8474 (such a lovely place)
    8596 Such a lovely face
    8870 Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    9328 Any time of year
    9454 (any time of year)
    9575 You can find it here
    9861 
    9861 Her mind is Tiffany twisted
   10099 She got the Mercedes bends
   10344 She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
   10613 That she calls friends
   10859 How they dance in the courtyard
   11062 Sweet summer sweat
   11340 Some dance to remember
   11584 Some dance to forget
   11830 
   11830 So I called up the Captain
   12058 "Please bring me my wine"
   12247 He said
   12308 "We haven't had that spirit here
   12504 since 1969"
   12809 And still those voices are calling
   12982 from far away
   13298 Wake you up in the middle of the night
   13543 Just to hear them say
   13703 
   13786 Welcome to the Hotel California
   14207 Such a lovely place
   14339 (such a lovely place)
   14450 Such a lovely face
   14711 They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
   15193 What a nice surprise
   15321 (what a nice surprise)
   15437 Bring your alibies
   15676 
   15740 Mirrors on the ceiling
   15984 The pink champagne on ice
   16120 And she said
   16228 We are all just prisoners here
   16471 of our own device
   16710 And in the master's chambers
   16949 They gathered for the feast
   17196 They stab it with their steely knives
   17387 But they just can't kill the beast
   17698 
   17698 Last thing I remember
   17875 I was running for the door
   18195 I had to find the passage back
   18359 to the place I was before
   18670 "Relax", said the nightman
   18859 "We are programmed to receive
   19157 You can check out any time you like
   19391 But you can never leave"
