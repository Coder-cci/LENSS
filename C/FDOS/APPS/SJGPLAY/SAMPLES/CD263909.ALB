@SONG: Silent Running
    6293 Take the children and yourself
    6520 And hide out in the cellar
    6798 By now the fighting
    6929 will be close at hand
    7393 Don't believe the church and state
    7620 And everything they tell you
    7894 Believe in me
    8030 I'm with the high command
    8316 
    8420 Can you hear me?
    8697 Can you hear me running?
    8971 Can you hear me running?
    9109 Can you hear me calling you?

   10214 Can you hear me calling you?
   10516 
   10689 There's a gun and ammunition
   10929 Just inside the doorway
   11204 Use it only in emergency
   11789 Better you should praise the God
   12017 The Father and the Spirit
   12291 Will guide you
   12393 and protect you from up here
   12715 
   12818 Can you hear me?

   16142 
   17298 Swear allegiance to the flag
   17517 Whatever flag they offer
   17847 Never hint at what you really feel
   18383 Teach the children quietly
   18618 For some day sons and daughters
   18887 We'll rise up
   19009 and fight while we stood still
   19346

@SONG: All I Need Is a Miracle
    3671 I said,
    3727 "Go if you wanna go,
    3990 Stay if you wanna stay"
    4204 I didn't care if you hung around me
    4473 I didn't care if you went away
    4759 And I know you were never right
    5020 I'll admit I was never wrong
    5293 I could never make up my mind
    5534 I made it up as I went along
    5714 
    5806 And though I treated you like a child
    6075 I'm gonna miss you for the rest of my life
    6367 
    6688 All I need is a miracle
    6874 All I need is you
    7221 All I need is a miracle
    7410 All I need is you
    7755 All I need is a miracle
    7939 All I need is you
    8185 
    8383 I never had any time
    8609 And I never had any call
    8878 But I went out of my way
    9005 just to hurt you
    9172 The one I shouldn't hurt at all
    9438 I thought I was being cool
    9683 Yeah, I thought I was being strong
    9937 But it's always the same old story
   10199 You never know what you've got 'til it's gone
   10400 
   10485 If I ever catch up with you
   10733 I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life
   11053 
   11353 All I need is a miracle
   11538 All I need is you
   11751 (All I need is a miracle)
   11885 All I need is a miracle
   12065 All I need is you

   12416 All I need is a miracle
   12602 All I need is you
   13738 
   14079 And if I ever catch up with you
   14331 I'm gonna love you for the rest of your life
   14689 
   14945 All I need is a miracle
   15133 All I need is you

@SONG: Taken In
    1759 Taken in
    1910 Taken in again
    2102 Wrapped around the finger of some
    2307 fair-weather friend
    2494 Caught up in the promises
    2690 left out in the end
    2931 No pride
    3073 Taken for a ride
    3268 You say I'm the only one
    3438 when I look in your eyes
    3657 I want to believe you
    3830 but you know how to lie
    4006 
    4743 And if you say you understand
    4939 I don't believe it
    5130 And when you reach out for my hand
    5325 I don't believe it
    5524 And if you say you take the blame
    5713 I don't believe it
    5904 And if you say that nothing's changed
    6099 I don't believe it
    6218 Don't believe it
    6357 
    7572 Taken in
    7720 Taken in again
    7915 Someone saw me coming
    8085 A fool without a friend
    8283 There's one born every minute
    8449 and you're looking at him
    8736 
    9393 And if you say you want me near
    9583 I don't believe it
    9777 And when you're holding back the tears
    9971 I don't believe it
   10163 And when you swear that you are mine
   10358 I don't believe it
   10551 And it's your heart that's on the line
   10745 I don't believe it
   10864 Don't believe it
   10991 
   12222 Taken in
   12367 Taken in again

   14440 
   14482 You say you want me near
   14615 I don't believe it
   14807 And when you're holding back the tears
   15009 I don't believe it

@SONG: Nobody's Perfect
     848 It must be hard
    1052 being an angel
    1261 When the devil in your heart
    1411 won't set you free

    6596 of what I'm saying here
    6769 That the person here in question

    7695 Oh, gentlemen please

@SONG: The Living Years
    2218 Every generation
    2575 blames the one before
    2937 And all of their frustrations
    3297 come beating on your door
    3665 I know that I'm a prisoner
    3808 To all my father held so dear
    4037 I know that I'm a hostage
    4221 To all his hopes and fears
    4378 I just wish I could have told him
    4606 In the living years
    4999 
    5108 Wo-oh
    5164 Crumpled bits of paper
    5477 Filled with imperfect thought
    5892 Stilted conversations
    6211 I'm afraid that's all we've got
    6512 
    6613 You say you just don't see it
    6803 He says it's perfect sense
    6987 You just can't get agreement
    7165 in this present tense
    7317 We all talk a different language
    7552 Talking in defence
    7939 
    8013 (Say it loud)
    8211 Say it loud
    8354 (Say it clear)
    8534 Wo-oh say it clear
    8747 (You can listen)
    8973 as well as you hear
    9479 (It's too late)
    9688 It's too late
    9844 (When we die)
   10021 wo-oh when we die
   10216 (to admit)
   10371 we don't see
   10567 eye to eye
   10890 
   10992 So we open up a quarrel
   11353 between the present and the past
   11707 We only sacrifice the future
   12090 It's the bitterness that lasts
   12404 
   12494 So don't yield to the fortunes
   12687 You sometimes see as fate
   12836 It may have a new perspective
   13060 on a different day
   13213 and if you don't give up
   13333 and don't give in
   13422 you may just be okay.
   13776 
   13832 So say it say it
   13939 Say it loud
   14251 (say it clear)
   14416 Wo-oh say it clear
   14623 (You can listen)
   14855 as well as you hear
   15339 Because it's too late
   15363 (It's too late)
   15566 It's too late
   15735 (When we die)
   15898 wo-oh when we die
   16097 (to admit)
   16254 we don't see
   16447 eye to eye
   16866 
   16922 I wasn't there that morning
   17246 when my father passed away
   17648 I didn't get to tell him
   17981 all the things I had to say
   18390 I think I caught his spirit
   18577 later that same year
   18744 I'm sure I heard his echo
   18912 in my baby's new born tears
   19094 I just wish I could have told him
   19318 in the living years
   19691 
   19721 So say it say say it loud
   20144 (say it clear)
   20300 Come on say it clear
   20510 (You can listen)
   20743 as well as you hear
   21247 (It's too late)
   21448 It's too late
   21619 (When we die)
   21756 It's too late when we die
   21977 (to admit)

    7865 I'm on a tightrope
    8050 I'm afraid to look down
    8337 Yes I'm almost approaching
    8689 the point of no return
    9036 Sometimes I wonder
    9237 if I'll ever learn
    9471

    9823 that you ought to be proud

@SONG: Word of Mouth
      49 Here we go
     253 Come on
     941 Come on
    1155 
    1668 Now the world is
    1850 gettin' older
    2024 There's a few things
    2197 to be said
    2363 Do you believe the
    2534 things they told you
    2705 Do you believe the
    2873 things you've read
    2993 
    3047 There's a rumour
    3222 on the corner
    3395 but it's always
    3565 been denied
    3738 Cause they don't want you
    3909 any wiser
    4077 You're just toein'
    4250 the party line
    4371 
    4404 From the west side
    4596 to the east side
    4763 From the north side
    4937 to the south
    5106 You'll never get bad
    5276 information
    5447 If you believe in
    5606 the word of mouth
    5727 
    5785 Look out for those who
    5962 still want to hang on
    6136 Look out for those who
    6305 live in the past
    6477 Get out and listen
    6654 to the whisper
    6821 Because the times are
    6976 changin' fast
    7099 
    7155 From the west side
    7337 to the east side
    7521 From the north side
    7681 to the south
    7849 You'll never get bad
    8023 information
    8184 If you believe in
    8363 the word of mouth
    8482 
    8537 You don't believe the
    8708 information
    8873 You don't believe it
    9050 when it's denied
    9221 So when you're reading
    9393 explanations
    9563 You have to read
    9670 between the lines
    9846 
    9906 From the west side
   10082 to the east side

@SONG: Beggar on a Beach of Gold
    1303 I didn't know when I was lucky
    1659 Discontented, feeling bad
    1989 Filed with envy
    2150 for possessions other people had
    2444 
    2626 I found my pride
    2744 had always hurt me
    2978 Fought the world to gain control
    3287 Not realisin'
    3475 I was sitting on a beach of gold
    3762 
    3884 Oh lord I'm a poor man
    4215 with all the riches I can hold
    4630 I'm a beggar
    4794 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
    5116 
    5301 The problems I encountered
    5624 gave me strength helped me sustain
    5931 To know the pleasure
    6161 first I had to cure the pain
    6470 
    6592 When I was searchin' for solutions
    6918 I found the answer lay in me
    7273 I'm a drifter
    7438 but I'm driftin' on a silver sea
    7692 
    7843 Oh lord I'm a poor man
    8177 with all the riches I can hold
    8594 I'm a beggar
    8757 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold
    9062 
    9355 I didn't have courage
    9518 my life was as dark as night
   10000 When alone in the darkness
   10202 I saw the brightest light
   10468 Let the light shine down
   11528 
   11895 Are you out there now on empty
   12227 Feel you've nothin' left to give
   12558 sick of tryin'
   12761 Have you lost the will to live?
   13044 
   13208 Don't be drownin' in the shallows
   13547 with the beach so near at hand
   13858 Hear the voice say
   14025 Stand up get up
   14192 and join me on the gilded sand
   14336 
   14453 Come and join me on the beach
   14780 with all the riches I can hold
   15177 Cause I'm a beggar
   15360 and I'm sitting on a beach of gold

@SONG: Another Cup of Coffee
    1099 As she pours herself another cup of coffee
    1649 As she contemplates the stain across the wall
    2192 And it's in between the cleaning and the washing
    2740 That's when looking back's
    2894 the hardest part of all
    3176 
    3284 And she always did her best
    3493 to try and please him
    3824 While he always did his best
    4052 to make her cry
    4376 And she got down on her knees
    4596 to stop him leaving
    4921 But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye
    5348 
    5550 Where are your friends?
    5686 Where are your children?
    6094 Is this your house?
    6235 Is this your home?
    6638 Does nothing ever last forever?
    7186 Does everybody sleep alone?
    7674 Alone
    7927 
    8196 And he tears the business tags from his old suitcase
    8739 As he packs away the pieces of his life
    9285 They all love him
    9418 but they always try to change him
    9832 That's what happens when a girl becomes a wife
   10266 
   10376 As she pours herself another cup of coffee
   10922 As the pictures leave a clean space on the wall
   11467 And it's in between the leaving and the loving
   12009 That's when looking back's
   12173 the hardest part of all
   12396 
   12641 Where are your friends?
   12780 Where are your children?
   13190 Is this your house?

    1528 then was done
    1757 Now I stare into a cold and empty well
    2417 The many sounds that meet our ears

    6452 must never end
