My mouth is dry
my legs are weak
thinkin' this
'Cause I can't speak
I' lookin' at you
you lookin' at me
you must think that
I'm just crazy
If you only knew
what your putting through
It feels like
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack

Must have died and
gone to heaven
what a way to go ....

I can't catch my breath
must be a dream
but you're the cutest thing
I've every seen
I'm way past the point
of recovery
you're gonna be
the death of me

If you only knew
what you're putting me through
It feels like
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack

Must have died and
gone to heaven
what a way to go ....

a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack

a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack
a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack

a heart attack
you're giving me a heart attack
a heart attack
