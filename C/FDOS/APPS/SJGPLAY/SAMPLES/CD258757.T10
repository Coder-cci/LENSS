     839 An old man turned ninety-eight
    1270 He won the lottery and died the next day
    1689 It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
    2122 It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
    2509 Isn't it ironic. . .don't you think

    2885 It's like rain on your wedding day
    3311 It's a free ride when you've already paid
    3738 It's the good advice you just didn't take
    4222 Who would've thought. . .it figures

    4630 Mr. Play it Safe was afraid to fly
    5009 He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
    5435 He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
    5885 And as the plane crashed down he thought
    6127 "Well isn't this nice. . ."
    6280 And isn't it ironic. . .don't you think
         
    6673 It's like rain on your wedding day

    8439 Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
    8693 When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
    9268 And life has a funny way of helping you out when
    9530 You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
    9819 In your face

   10132 A traffic jam when you're already late
   10510 A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
   10950 It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
   11393 It's meeting the man of my dreams
   11599 And then meeting his beautiful wife
   11879 And isn't it ironic. . .don't you think
   12288 A little too ironic. . .and yeah I really do think. . .

   12700 It's like rain on your wedding day
   13140 It's a free ride when you've already paid
   13555 It's the good advice you just didn't take
