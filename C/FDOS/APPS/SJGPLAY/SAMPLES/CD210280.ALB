@SONG: Hannah Jane
    1263 You've got your big girls
    1555 Now you have your young one too
    1840 Wonder if someday I can have them
    2152 The way I once had you
    2345 
    2419 I remember your crazy remarks
    2709 We'd get drunk and go out after dark
    2985 Searching for someone
    3176 we could take home
    3242 
    3281 You don't wanna be alone
    3576 You don't wanna see the sun go down
    3865 You don't wanna open the door
    4177 And see her go
    4437 One step and tomorrow comes
    4729 Two steps and she's off with someone
    5019 Three steps and it's all you know
    5295 You'll be home,
    5438 she'll be gone
    5566 
    5622 So what are you gonna do about me
    5895 I'll be there when you have
    6057 no one else
    6158 Spot in the ocean in the south's holy land
    6462 I'll be there,
    6595 be your friend
    6732 
    6794 Hold on strong,
    6921 don't let go
    7065 There'll never be no one to
    7220 take your place
    7313 So don't you wanna reach out
    7509 and take my hand
    7570 
    7614 You don't wanna be alone
    7916 You don't wanna see the sun go down
    8214 You don't wanna open the door
    8511 And see her go
    8775 One step and tomorrow comes
    9062 Two steps and she's off with someone
    9352 Three steps and it's all you know
    9620 You'll be home
    9785 she'll be gone
   11250 
   11935 Ahhhh
   12117 You don't wanna be alone
   12401 You don't wanna see the sun go down
   12694 You don't wanna open the door
   12959 see her go
   13105 see her go
   13177 no no
   13252 
   13266 One step and tomorrow comes
   13553 Two steps and she's off with someone
   13839 Three steps and it's all you know
   14112 You'll be home
   14253 she'll be gone
   14374 
   14413 One step and tomorrow comes
   14699 Two steps and she's off with someone
   14984 Three steps and it's all you know
   15254 You'll be home
   15403 she'll be gone

@SONG: Hold My Hand
     851 With a little love
    1072 and some tenderness
    1317 We'll walk upon the water
    1560 We'll rise above the mist
    1739 With a little peace,
    1948 and some harmony
    2221 We'll take the world together
    2439 We'll take 'em by the hand
    2718 'Cause I've got a hand for you, ahhh
    3131 'Cause I wanna run with you
    3405 Yes indeed
    3658 I saw you standing there
    3918 Your head was down, your eyes were red
    4127 No comb had touched your hair
    4257 I said get up,
    4461 and let me see you smile
    4743 We'll take a walk together
    4952 Walk the road awhile, 'cause
    5231 'Cause I've got a hand for you

    8668 and I was a'wastin' time
    8904 'Till I thought about your problems,
    9117 I thought about your crimes
    9256 Then I stood up,
    9464 and then I screamed aloud
    9707 I don't wanna be part of your problems
    9903 Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no
   10239 'Cause I've got a hand for you
   10633 I've gotta hand for you

@SONG: Let Her Cry
      89 She sits alone by a lamp post
     597 Tryin' to find a thought
     686 that's escaped her mind
    1109 She says, there's the one I love the most
    1633 And Stipes not far behind
    2011 
    2114 She never lets me in
    2322 only tells me where she's been
    2644 when she's had too much to drink
    3126 I say that I don't care
    3295 I just run my hands
    3446 through her dark hair
    3552 then I pray to God you gotta Help me fly away
    3980 
    3995 And just let her cry,
    4318 If the tears fall down like rain
    4545 Let her sing,
    4816 If it eases all her pain
    5045 Let her go,
    5316 Let her walk right out on me
    5576 And if the sun comes up tomorrow
    5810 Let her be
    6057 Let her be
    7044 
    7180 This mornin' I woke up alone
    7412 found a note standin' by the phone
    7660 sayin' maybe,
    7790 maybe I'll be back someday
    8179 I wanted to look for you
    8336 you walked in,
    8401 I didn't know just what I should do
    8577 So I,
    8637 sat back down
    8722 and had a beer
    8822 and felt sorry for myself
    8992 
    9018 Sayin' let her cry
    9324 If the tears fall down like rain
    9561 Let her sing,
    9826 If it eases all her pain
   10058 Let her go,
   10333 Let her walk right out on me
   10573 And if the sun comes up tomorrow

   14085 Let her go,
   14360 Let her walk right out on me
   14610 and if the sun comes up tommorow
   14859 Let her be,
   15049 Ahhh
   15644 
   16268 Last night I tried to leave
   16520 Cried so much I could not believe
   16774 She was the same girl
   16901 I fell in love with long ago
   17301 She went in the back to get high
   17550 I sat down on my couch and cried
   17725 yellin',
   17805 Woman, woh, please help me
   18049 won't you hold my hand and
   18173 
   18229 Let her cry,
   18509 If the tears fall down like rain
   18736 Let her sing,
   19014 If it eases all her pain
   19243 Let her go,
   19507 Let her walk right out on me
   19761 And if the sun comes up tomorrow,
   20012 Let her be
   20153 
   20240 Let her cry,
   20524 If the tears fall down like rain
   20747 Let her sing,
   21025 If it eases all her pain
   21257 Let her go,
   21530 Let her walk right out on me
   21782 And if the sun comes up tomorrow

   22220 Oh, let her be.

@SONG: Only Wanna Be With You
    1440 You and me,
    1565 we come from different worlds
    1770 You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
    2113 Sometimes you're crazy,
    2281 then you wonder why
    2457 I'm such a baby
    2551 cause the Dolphins make me cry
    2733 But there's nothing I can do

    6964 Said I shot a man named Gray
    7138 Took his wife to Italy
    7306 She inherited a million bucks,
    7434 and when she died
    7528 it came to me
    7602 I can't help it if I'm lucky

    2924 There's so much I,
    3072 I still have to say
    3353 The sky ripped open and I held my heart in my hand
    3714 Like a soldier on his very last day
    4032 Cried myself to sleep that night
    4195 And I listened as I heard the angels sing
    4457 
    4490 Sha la la

  999999 I beg, "No, no not yet"
  999999 You left six of us to fend for ourselves
  999999 Guess it's just part of someone's master plan
  999999 We'll say you left cause you're my best friend
  999999 You were a light to them,
  999999 And I smiled when the angels sang...

@SONG: Drowning
Trouble with the world is we're too busy to think about it, all right
Why is there a rebel flag hanging from the state house walls?
Tired of hearin' this shit about heritage not hate
Time to make the world a better place
Why must we hate one another?
Well no matter what we gotta live together
Just that
you don't look like me,
tell me what do you see
When we pass on the street
what do you wanna see

P.E.'s coming
is all I gotta say
Wanna turn and run away
They're just telling you how they see it
Right or wrong they don't care,
you wish that they would quit

chorus:
Drowning
in a sea of tears
Hatred
trying to hide your fears
Living
only for yourself
Hating
everybody else
Cause they don't look like you

Nanci singing it's a hard life wherever you go
About some fat racist
living in Chicago
Trying to teach his kids to hate everyone
Well tell me why is that something you wanna teach your son?

Why must we hate one another?
When the people in the church,
they tell me you're my brother
You don't walk like me,
... you don't talk like me,
saying Go back to Africa,
I just don't understand

Drowning
in a sea of tears
Hatred
trying to hide your fears
Living
only for yourself
Hating
everybody else
Cause they don't look like you

I'm trying to be someone that
he could look up to,
but When I walk down the street,
tell me what do you see
I'm a man, I'm a man, I'm a man
No I'm not like you
Why do you hate me so
I don't know,
I don't know,
I don't know
Hating
everybody else
cause they don't look like you

Drowning
in a sea of tears
Hatred
trying to hide your fears
Living
only for yourself
Hating
everybody else
Cause they don't look like you

Drowning...

@SONG: Time
     710 Time,
    1000 why you punish me
    1386 Like a wave bashing into the shore
    1700 You wash away my dreams.
    2109 Time,
    2401 why you walk away
    2782 Like a friend with somewhere to go
    3127 You left my crying
    3491 Can you teach me about tomorrow
    3664 And all the pain and sorrow
    3899 Running free
    4208 Cause tomorrow's just another day
    4462 And I don't believe in time
    5041 
    5254 Time,
    5532 I don't understand
    5907 Children killing in the street
    6175 Dying for the color of a rag
    6603 Time,
    6881 hey there red and blue
    7273 Wash them in the ocean,
    7406 make them clean,
    7555 Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight
    7944 Can you teach me about tomorrow
    8115 All the pain and sorrow
    8332 Running free
    8627 But tomorrow's just another day
    8884 And I don't believe in...
    8950 
    9005 Time is wasting
    9094 Time is walking
    9201 You ain't no friend of mine
    9369 I don't know where I'm goin'
    9546 I think I'm out of my mind
    9955 Thinking about time
   10457 And if I die tomorrow, yeah
   10614 Just lay me down in sleep
   12184 
   12294 Time is wasting
   12369 Time is walking
   12477 You ain't no friend of mine
   12645 I don't know where I'm goin'
   12821 I think I'm out of my mind
   13221 Thinking about time
   14190 
   14303 Time,
   14361 you left me standing there
   14650 Like a tree growing all alone
   14954 The wind just stripped me bare,
   15106 stripped me bare
   15354 Time,
   15625 the past has come and gone
   15978 The future's far away
   16306 Now only lasts for one second,
   16516 one second
   16703 Can you teach me about tomorrow
   16877 And all the pain and sorrow
   17098 Running free
   17396 'Cause tomorrow's just another day
   17661 And I don't believe in
   17777 time
   18249 
   18301 (chorus)
   18409 
   20137 Time, why you punish me

@SONG: Look Away
Saw her standing there
Tears upon her cheeks told me something was wrong
I asked her what it was
She looked away and said,
"My daddy's home"
I knew what that meant
It meant that I can never see you again
I had seen this once
before
I didn't wanna deal with it anymore
"Look away", she said
As she turned away from me And I
tried to hold her
Couldn't let her be
Let her be,
let her be
I said
"Why,
Why do you make me cry"
She said,
"I love you so
Look away,
I don't wanna know"
I saw her standing there
Tears upon her cheek told me something's wrong
I said, "What baby"
She looked away and said,
"My daddy's home"
"Look away", she said
As she turned away, my God I
know I loved her
couldn't let her be
Let her be,
let her be
Look away
Look away
She said, "I love you so
Look away"

@SONG: Not Even the Trees
Alone
as I sit and watch the trees
Won't you tell me if I scream will they bend down and listen to me
And it makes me wonder
if I know the world will you come
Or will you laugh at me
Or will I run

Little boy says to me,
"Where you goin' now son"
I said, "I don't know where I'm goin' boy
I only know where I'm from"
And it makes me wonder
If the stars shine when my eyes close
Or does my brothers heart cry
Oh I don't
now I'm a stranger in my home
Now that everybody's gone
Someone please talk to me
Cause I feel you cry
And you're sitting with him
And I know I'll never
see you again

Lying down in Charleston under the Carolina sky
You see I'm tired of feeling this pain
I'm tired of living my own little lie
And it makes me wonder
When I see you in my dreams
Does it mean anything
Are you trying to talk to me
I'm a stranger in my home
Tell me are you feeling alone
Someone tell me what to do
'Cause I'm feeling strong
And I wonder how you feel
Do you realize
my pain is for real
I see you in my dreams
And I wonder if you're looking down at me And smiling right now
I wanna know if it's true
When he looks at me
Won't you tell me
Does he realize he came down here
And he took you too soon
Oh lord

And now my days are short an my nights are long
I lay down with memories of you
thatkeep that keep me going on,
going on
It makes me wonder as I sit and stare
Will I see your face again
Tell me, do you care
I'm a stranger in my home
Living life on my own
Right now I just can't see
'Cause I'm feeling weak
And my soul begins to bleed
And no one is listening to me,
not even the trees
Oh no no no

@SONG: Goodbye
Tomorrow
used to be a day away
Now love is gone
and you're into someone
far away
I never thought the day would come
When I would see his hand not mine
Holding on to yours
because I could not
Find the time

And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't wanna leave
and see the teardrops
in your eyes
I don't wanna live
to see the day we say goodbye

Now there comes another fallen life
I come alone
Sitting at a bar with Chris
that I can't leave
cause my house ain't no home
I just wanna touch you girl
I wanna feel you close to me
Without your love
I would give up now
And walk away so easily
So baby why break up
We'll figure out together
That even with the pain
there's a remedy
We'll be all right
I don't wanna live to see the day
we say goodbye ohhh

When I first met you I couldn't love anyone
But you stole my dreams
and you made me see that I can
walk into the sun and I could
still be me And now I can't deny
Nothing lasts forever
But I don't wanna leave
and see the teardrops
in your eyes
So baby why break up
Lets figure out together
That even with the pain
there's a remedy,
and We'll be all right
I don't wanna live
to see the day
we say goodbye
We say goodbye
Oh goodbye
Goodbye
