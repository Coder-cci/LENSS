; TITLE: If we could start over
; CD   : Celine Dion - Unison
; ------
I never found out
why you walked away
and never said goodbye
But now that I see you
I'm torn inside,
but I've still got my pride

I understand
that some things
are better left unsaid
I'm afraid of the truth
But what can I do
if I still want you

If we could start over again
I know if we try
our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
That we'd never have to let go

For so many years now
I've held inside
things I meant to say
but faced with the past
now I realize
I can't let that stand in our way

I never knew that a love
so strong would never fade
but what can we do
If I still want you
And you want me too

If we could start over again
I know if we try
our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
That we'd never have to let go

How can we walk away
From something that was once so strong
Have we the strength
to say we're wrong

If we could start over again
I know if we try
our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
That we'd never have to let go

If we could start over again
I know if we try
our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
we'd never have to let go

we could be stronger

If we could start over again
I know if we try
our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, wo oh
We'd never have to let go

I know, I know, I know
