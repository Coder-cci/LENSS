     885 
     939 Looking back
    1185 over my shoulder
    1429 I can see
    1550 that look in your eyes
    1820 I never dreamed
    1966 it could be over
    2162 I never wanted
    2377 to say goodbye
    2465 
    2504 Looking back
    2746 over my shoulder
    2987 With an achin'
    3134 deep in my heart
    3378 I wish we
    3522 were starting over
    3724 Oh instead of drifting
    3940 so far apart
    4050 
    4161 Everybody
    4294 told me you were leaving
    4548 Funny I
    4671 should be the last to know
    4938 Baby please
    5078 tell me that I'm dreaming
    5281 I just never want to let you go
    5582 
    5818 Looking back
    6061 over my shoulder
    6305 I can see
    6426 that look in your eyes
    6692 Turning my heart
    6839 over and over
    7035 I never wanted
    7254 to say goodbye
    7375 
    7477 I don't mind
    7609 everybody laughing
    7856 but it's enough
    7986 to make a grown man cry
    8239 Cos I can feel
    8376 you slippin' through my fingers
    8595 I don't even know the reason why
    8878

   10785 Every day
   10930 it's a loosin' battle
   11180 Just to smile
   11301 and hold my head up high
   11570 Could it be
   11706 we belong together
   11906 Baby, won't you give me one more try
   12436 One more try
   12506 
   12612 Looking back
   12806 oh, over my shoulder
   13120 (I can see)
   13196 See that look in your eye
   13519 (I never dreamed)
   13582 oh, that it could be over
   13846 Well I never wanted
   14075 to say goodbye
   14151 
   14203 (Lookin' back)
   14273 Looking back
   14446 (over my shoulder)
   14578 Ohh, with an aching
   14683 (there's an ache)
   14832 feeling inside
   15073 (Cutting me up)
   15138 Oh deeper and deeper
   15415 (fills me with a sadness)
   15591 I can't hide
   15652 (I can't hide)
   15764 (looking back..)
