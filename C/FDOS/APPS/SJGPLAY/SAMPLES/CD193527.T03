; ------
So much to believe in
We were lost in time
Everything I needed
fell into your eyes
Always thought of keepin
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love
could leave without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
Can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go

Candle in the water
Drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by the hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand
that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms
that let me know
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
Can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go
Where do all the lonely hearts go

The one touch
overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside

I need someone to give my heart to

I feel it getting stronger
and stronger
and stronger
(Yeah)

I feel it inside

Hearts are made to last
Till the end of time
