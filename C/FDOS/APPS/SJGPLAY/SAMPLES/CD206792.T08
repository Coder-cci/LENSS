    1032 I'm feeling so alone now
    1268 They cut the telephone uh huh
    1506 Yeah my life is just a mess
    1811 
    1985 I threw it all away now
    2220 I could have made a fortune
    2439 I lost the craving for success
    2739 
    2816 And as the acrobats they tumble
    3072 So the corn begins to crumble
    3312 While in the mirror
    3392 She admires a brand new dress
    3777 
    3921 Live on the second floor now
    4178 They're trying to bust the door down
    4418 Soon I'll have a new address
    4704 
    4910 So much for liberation
    5150 They'll have a celebration
    5402 Yeah I've been under too much stress
    5649 
    5760 And as the cloud begin to rumble
    6009 So the juggler makes his fumble
    6251 And the sun upon my wall is getting less
    6642 
    6735 Don't, give a damn
    6995 Fight, while you can
    7232 Kill, shoot 'em up
    7470 They'll run amuck
    7704 Shout, Judas
    7947 Loud, they'll hear us
    8180 Soldier, sailor
    8652 They'll run for cover when they discover
    8883 Everyone's a nervous wreck now
   10059 
   11139 I used to think she was so nimble
   11387 Would have bought her as symbol
   11633 But now I can't afford the pen to sign her checks
   12135 Don't give a damn............................
   13923 
   14030 They'll run for cover when they discover
   14253 Everyone's a nervous wreck now
   14484 Life's just a bummer they got your number
   14751 We'll give as good as we get now
   14943 Rise from the gutter, stick with each other
   15209 We'll drive 'em over the edge now
   15435 They're gonna bleed, that's what they need
   15674 We'll get together and blow their cover
   15842 We're ready
   15956 Yeah we're ready
   16074 Yeah we're ready
   16212
