    1878 I used to cry myself
    2042 to sleep at night
    2291 But that was all
    2517 Before he came
    2817 I thought love had to hurt
    2996 to turn out right
    3238 But now he's here
    3479 It's not the same
    3717 It's not the same
    4018 
    4135 He fills me up
    4365 He gives me love
    4688 More love than I've ever seen
    5055 He's all I've got
    5330 He's all I got in this world
    5607 But he's all the man that I need
    6293 
    6402 And in the morning
    6550 when I kiss his eyes
    6807 He takes me down
    7053 and rocks me slow
    7353 And in the evening
    7501 when the moon is high
    7770 He holds me close
    8008 and won't let go
    8242 He won't let go
    8558 
    8663 He fills me up
    8901 He gives me love
    9683 More love than I've ever seen
    9874 He's all I've got
   10159 He's all I got in this world
   10767 But he's all the man that I need
   12684 
   12953 He fills me up
   13281 He gives me love
   13656 More love than I've ever seen
   13905 He's all I've got
   14182 He's all I got in this world
   14581 But he's all the man that I need
   14627 
   14865 He fills me up
   15099 He gives me love
   15154 More love,
   15216 More love,
   15274 More love,
   15380 More love than I've ever seen
   15625 He's all I've got
   15814 He's all I got in this world
   16071 But he's all the man that I need
