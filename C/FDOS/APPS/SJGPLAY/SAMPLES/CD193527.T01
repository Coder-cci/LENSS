Sorry I know I'm late
Guess I lost all track of time
Started walking and couldn't stop
turning it over in my mind
Trying to make some sense of it
Trying to make the pieces fit
Thought I covered my tracks so well
But now he says
he knew about it from the start
Yeah he knew about us all along ...

If there was any other way
love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way
love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way ...

Maybe I'd better be leaving now
But there something I want you
to understand before I go
Sometimes we don't have a choice
When we play and break the rules
Just had to see you darlin',
one more time
If only just to say goodbye
'Cos he knew about us all the time

If there was any other way
love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way
love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way ...

I never wanted it to be like this
I never meant to be serious
But now the thought of losing you
Takes some getting used to

If there was any other way
love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
If there was any other way
love
There's no way out of this
There just ain't any other way ...

If there was any other way
love
Don't you think I've tried to find it
Don't you think I want to stay
