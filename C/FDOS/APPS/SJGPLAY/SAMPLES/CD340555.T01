    8254 And I would do anything for love
    8685 I'd run right into hell and back
    9112 I would do anything for love
    9481 I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
    9744 
    9974 But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
   10355 Oh no
   10562 no way
   10697 And I would do anything for love
   11099 But I won't do that
   11485 No I won't do that
   11560 
   11644 Anything for love
   11928 Oh I would do anything for love
   12332 I would do anything for love
   12688 But I won't do that
   13071 No I won't do that
   13252 
   14666 And some days it don't come easy
   14910 And some days it don't come hard
   15144 Some days it don't come at all
   15304 And these are the days that never end
   15560 
   15633 And some nights you're breathing fire
   15870 And some nights you're carved in ice
   16120 Some nights are like nothing I've ever seen before
   16408 or will again
   16550 
   16608 And maybe I'm crazy
   16783 Oh it's crazy and it's true
   17117 I know you can save me
   17259 No one else can save me now but you
   17504 
   17630 As long as the planets are turnin'
   17866 As long as the stars are burnin'
   18109 As long as your dreams are comin' true
   18352 Ya better believe it
   18432 
   18496 And I would do anything for love
   18851 And I'll be there till the final act
   19239 And I would do anything for love
   19571 And I'll take a vow and seal a pact
   19838 
   20025 But I'll never forgive myself
   20202 if we don't go all the way
   20539 tonight
   20660 And I would do anything for love
   21017 Oh I would do anything for love
   21376 Oh I would do anything for love
   21719 But I won't do that
   22060 No I won't do that
   22189

   22460 Anything you've been dreaming of
   22691 But I just won't do that

   23858 Anything you've been dreaming of
   24093 But I just won't do that
   24294 
   28077 And some days I pray for silence
   28310 And some days I pray for soul
   28545 Somedays I just pray to the God of
   28740 Sex and Drums and Rock'n'Roll
   28992 
   29017 And some nights I loose the feeling
   29256 And some nights I loose control
   29482 Some nights I just loose it all
   29637 when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls
   29864 
   29966 And maybe I'm lonely
   30116 That's all that I'm qualified to be
   30468 There's just one and only
   30604 one and only promise I can keep
   30852 
   30962 As long as the wheels are turnin'
   31193 As long as the fires are burnin'
   31428 As long as your prayers are comin true
   31663 Ya better believe it
   31738 
   31794 That I would do anything for love
   32142 And you know it's true and that's a fact
   32492 And I would do anything for love
   32829 And there'll never be no turnin' back
   33158 
   33276 But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
   33613 So long
   33768 So long
   33881 And I would do anything for love
