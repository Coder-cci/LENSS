@SONG: West End Girls
    3381 Sometimes you're better off dead
    3501 There's a gun in your hand
    3585 and it's pointing at your head
    3675 You think you're mad,
    3747 too unstable
    3831 Kicking in chairs
    3894 and knocking down tables
    3978 In a restaurant
    4056 in a West End town
    4152 Call the police,
    4218 there's a madman around
    4311 Running down
    4389 underground
    4455 to a dive bar
    4533 In a West End town
    4590 
    4614 In a West End town,
    4689 a dead end world

    6120 
    6567 Too many shadows,
    6600 whispering voices
    6699 Faces on posters,
    6789 too many choices
    6858 If, when, why, what?
    7011 How much
    7077 have you got?
    7155 Have you got it,
    7203 do you get it,
    7239 if so, how often?
    7320 And which do you choose,
    7392 a hard or soft option?
    7521 (How much do you need?)

   13206 You've got a heart of glass
   13275 or a heart of stone
   13371 Just you wait
   13440 'till I get you home
   13530 We've got no future,
   13605 we've got no past
   13692 Here today,
   13764 built to last
   13830 In every city,
   13908 in every nation

@SONG: Love Comes Quickly
    2220 Sooner or later,
    2394 this happens to everyone
    2632 To everyone
    2778 
    3438 You can live your life lonely
    3825 Heavy as stone
    4161 Live your life learning 
    4482 And working alone
    4795 Say this is all you want
    5073 But I don't believe that it's true
    5482 'Cause when you least expect it
    5829 Waiting round the corner for you
    6073 
    6145 Love comes quickly,
    6327 whatever you do
    6450 You can't stop falling
    6655 (Ooh ooh)
    6810 Love comes quickly,
    6975 whatever you do
    7132 You can't stop falling
    7378 
    7446 You can live a life of luxury
    7813 If that's what you want
    8145 Taste forbidden pleasures
    8478 Whatever you want
    8724 
    8766 You can fly away to the end of the world
    9112 But where does it get you to?
    9471 'Cause just when you least expect it
    9837 Just what you least expect
   10093 
   10149 Love comes quickly,
   10324 whatever you do
   10440 You can't stop falling
   10656 (Ooh ooh)

   10974 whatever you do
   11112 You can't stop falling
   11320 (Ooh ooh)
   11454 
   11793 I know it sounds ridiculous,
   11970 but speaking from experience
   12325 It may seem romantic,
   12496 and that's no defense
   12657 Love will always get to you
   12703 
   13186 Sooner or later,
   13320 sooner or later,
   13450 this happens to everyone
   13629 To everyone
   13807 
   14103 You can fly away to the end of the world
   14464 But where does it get you?
   14718 
   14811 Love comes quickly,
   15006 whatever you do
   15117 You can't stop falling
   15325 (Ooh ooh)

   15655 whatever you do
   15789 You can't stop falling
   15993 (Ooh ooh)
   16150 Love comes quickly,
   16327 whatever you do
   16453 You can't stop falling
   16657 (Ooh ooh)
   16848 (Oooh)
   17140 
   18156 Love comes quickly,
   18333 whatever you do

@SONG: Suburbia
    2297 Lost in the high street,
    2473 where the dogs run
    2586 Roaming suburban boys
    2868 Mother's got a hairdo
    3057 to be done
    3150 She says they're too old for toys
    3448 Stood by the bus stop
    3624 with a felt pen
    3738 In this suburban hell
    4027 And in the distance
    4199 a police car
    4291 To break the suburban spell
    4614 
    4754 Let's take a ride,
    4924 and run with the dogs tonight
    5164 In Suburbia
    5399 You can't hide,
    5527 run with the dogs tonight
    5734 In Suburbia
    5919 
    5897 Break a window
    6055 by the town hall
    6152 Listen,
    6220 the siren screams
    6450 There in the distance,
    6620 like a roll call
    6729 Of all the suburban dreams
    6985 
    7166 Let's take a ride,
    7362 and run with the dogs tonight
    7590 In Suburbia
    7830 You can't hide,
    7950 run with the dogs tonight
    8162 In Suburbia
    8418 
    9490 I only wanted something else
    9768 to do but
    9879 hang around
   10056 I only wanted something else
   10338 to do but
   10450 hang around
   10591 (Hang around)
   10837 
   12005 It's on the front page
   12193 of the papers
   12299 This is their hour of need
   12588 Where's a policeman
   12759 when you need one
   12856 To blame the colour TV?
   13126 
   13284 Let's take a ride,
   13497 and run with the dogs tonight
   13726 In Suburbia
   13962 You can't hide,
   14098 run with the dogs tonight
   14302 In Suburbia
   14443 In Suburbia
   14582 In Suburbia
   14757 
   14915 Run with the dogs tonight

     228 (Twenty seconds and counting...

    2597 
    3380 When I look back upon my life
    3662 It's always with a sense of shame
    3956 I've always been the one to blame
    4653 For everything I long to do
    4940 No matter when or where or who
    5229 Has one thing in common, too
    5427 
    5522 It's a,

    6686 Every place I've ever been
    6828 Everywhere I'm going to
    7017 It's a sin
    7149 
    7203 At school they taught me how to be
    7467 So pure in thought
    7569 and word and deed
    7803 They didn't quite succeed
    8337 For everything I long to do

   10368 Every place I've ever been
   10509 Everywhere I'm going to
   10698 It's a sin
   10797 
   10865 Father, forgive me,
   11121 I tried not to do it
   11412 Turned over a new leaf,
   11696 then tore right through it
   11978 Whatever you taught me,
   12264 I didn't believe it
   12558 Father, you fought me,
   12713 'cause I didn't care
   12860 And I still don't understand
   13125 
   13416 So I look back upon my life
   13716 Forever with a sense of shame
   13995 I've always been the one to blame

    6253

    4579 anyone
    4673 who's ever gone
    4868 And opened up a closing door
    5170 She said:
    5237 "We were never feeling bored"
    5503 
    5652 'Cause we were never being boring
    5985 We had too much time
    6056 to find for ourselves
    6256 And we were never being boring
    6570 We dressed up and fought,
    6695 then thought: "Make amends"
    6850 And we were never holding back
    7078 or worried that
    7242 Time would come to an end"
    7442 
    7735 When I went
    7834 I left from the station
    7972 With a
    8033 haversack
    8128 and some trepidation
    8334 Someone said:
    8432 "If you're not careful
    8600 You'll have nothing left
    8737 and nothing to care for
    8872 In the nineteen
    9048 seventies"
    9224 But I sat back
    9331 and looking forward
    9492 My shoes were high
    9630 and I had scored
    9824 I'd bolted through a closing door
   10123 I would never find myself
   10345 feeling bored
   10537 
   10608 'Cause we were never being boring
   10925 We had too much time
   11041 to find for ourselves
   11211 And we were never being boring
   11527 We dressed up and fought,
   11639 then thought: "Make amends"
   11802 And we were never holding back
   12032 or worried that
   12202 Time would come to an end
   12423 We were always hoping that,
   12648 looking back
   12749 You could
   12794 always rely on a friend
   13071 
   14046 Now I sit
   14140 with different faces
   14288 In
   14341 rented rooms
   14440 and foreign places
   14641 All the people
   14741 I was kissing
   14939 Some are here
   15032 and some are missing
   15167 In the nineteen
   15355 nineties
   15530 I never dreamt
   15638 that I would get to be
   15833 The creature that
   15936 I always meant to be
   16142 But I thought
   16238 in spite of dreams
   16447 You'd be sitting
   16537 somewhere
   16615 here with me
   16814 
   16920 'Cause we were never being boring
   17230 We had too much time
   17344 to find for ourselves
   17510 And we were never being boring
   17834 We dressed up and fought,
   17947 then thought: "Make amends"
   18109 And we were never
   18207 holding back
   18343 or worried that
   18510 Time would come to an end
   18734 We were always hoping that,
   18955 looking back
   19053 You could
   19094 always rely on a friend
   19295 
   19343 And we were never being boring

   11007 The cities aflood
   11288 our love turns to rust
   11577 We're beaten and blown by the wind
   11862 trampled in dust
   12132 I'll show you a place
   12410 high on a desert plain
